    <h2>
      PART FIRST
    </h2>
    <p>
      To begin with I wish to disclaim the possession of those high gifts of
      imagination and expression which would have enabled my pen to create for
      the reader the personality of the man who called himself, after the
      Russian custom, Cyril son of Isidor&mdash;Kirylo Sidorovitch&mdash;Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have ever had these gifts in any sort of living form they have been
      smothered out of existence a long time ago under a wilderness of words.
      Words, as is well known, are the great foes of reality. I have been for
      many years a teacher of languages. It is an occupation which at length
      becomes fatal to whatever share of imagination, observation, and insight
      an ordinary person may be heir to. To a teacher of languages there comes a
      time when the world is but a place of many words and man appears a mere
      talking animal not much more wonderful than a parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being so, I could not have observed Mr. Razumov or guessed at his
      reality by the force of insight, much less have imagined him as he was.
      Even to invent the mere bald facts of his life would have been utterly
      beyond my powers. But I think that without this declaration the readers of
      these pages will be able to detect in the story the marks of documentary
      evidence. And that is perfectly correct. It is based on a document; all I
      have brought to it is my knowledge of the Russian language, which is
      sufficient for what is attempted here. The document, of course, is
      something in the nature of a journal, a diary, yet not exactly that in its
      actual form. For instance, most of it was not written up from day to day,
      though all the entries are dated. Some of these entries cover months of
      time and extend over dozens of pages. All the earlier part is a
      retrospect, in a narrative form, relating to an event which took place
      about a year before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must mention that I have lived for a long time in Geneva. A whole
      quarter of that town, on account of many Russians residing there, is
      called La Petite Russie&mdash;Little Russia. I had a rather extensive
      connexion in Little Russia at that time. Yet I confess that I have no
      comprehension of the Russian character. The illogicality of their
      attitude, the arbitrariness of their conclusions, the frequency of the
      exceptional, should present no difficulty to a student of many grammars;
      but there must be something else in the way, some special human trait&mdash;one
      of those subtle differences that are beyond the ken of mere professors.
      What must remain striking to a teacher of languages is the Russians&rsquo; 
      extraordinary love of words. They gather them up; they cherish them, but
      they don&rsquo;t hoard them in their breasts; on the contrary, they are always
      ready to pour them out by the hour or by the night with an enthusiasm, a
      sweeping abundance, with such an aptness of application sometimes that, as
      in the case of very accomplished parrots, one can&rsquo;t defend oneself from
      the suspicion that they really understand what they say. There is a
      generosity in their ardour of speech which removes it as far as possible
      from common loquacity; and it is ever too disconnected to be classed as
      eloquence.... But I must apologize for this digression.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be idle to inquire why Mr. Razumov has left this record behind
      him. It is inconceivable that he should have wished any human eye to see
      it. A mysterious impulse of human nature comes into play here. Putting
      aside Samuel Pepys, who has forced in this way the door of immortality,
      innumerable people, criminals, saints, philosophers, young girls,
      statesmen, and simple imbeciles, have kept self-revealing records from
      vanity no doubt, but also from other more inscrutable motives. There must
      be a wonderful soothing power in mere words since so many men have used
      them for self-communion. Being myself a quiet individual I take it that
      what all men are really after is some form or perhaps only some formula of
      peace. Certainly they are crying loud enough for it at the present day.
      What sort of peace Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov expected to find in the
      writing up of his record it passeth my understanding to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact remains that he has written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Razumov was a tall, well-proportioned young man, quite unusually dark
      for a Russian from the Central Provinces. His good looks would have been
      unquestionable if it had not been for a peculiar lack of fineness in the
      features. It was as if a face modelled vigorously in wax (with some
      approach even to a classical correctness of type) had been held close to a
      fire till all sharpness of line had been lost in the softening of the
      material. But even thus he was sufficiently good-looking. His manner, too,
      was good. In discussion he was easily swayed by argument and authority.
      With his younger compatriots he took the attitude of an inscrutable
      listener, a listener of the kind that hears you out intelligently and then&mdash;just
      changes the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sort of trick, which may arise either from intellectual insufficiency
      or from an imperfect trust in one&rsquo;s own convictions, procured for Mr.
      Razumov a reputation of profundity. Amongst a lot of exuberant talkers, in
      the habit of exhausting themselves daily by ardent discussion, a
      comparatively taciturn personality is naturally credited with reserve
      power. By his comrades at the St. Petersburg University, Kirylo
      Sidorovitch Razumov, third year&rsquo;s student in philosophy, was looked upon
      as a strong nature&mdash;an altogether trustworthy man. This, in a country
      where an opinion may be a legal crime visited by death or sometimes by a
      fate worse than mere death, meant that he was worthy of being trusted with
      forbidden opinions. He was liked also for his amiability and for his quiet
      readiness to oblige his comrades even at the cost of personal
      inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Razumov was supposed to be the son of an Archpriest and to be
      protected by a distinguished nobleman&mdash;perhaps of his own distant
      province. But his outward appearance accorded badly with such humble
      origin. Such a descent was not credible. It was, indeed, suggested that
      Mr. Razumov was the son of an Archpriest&rsquo;s pretty daughter&mdash;which, of
      course, would put a different complexion on the matter. This theory also
      rendered intelligible the protection of the distinguished nobleman. All
      this, however, had never been investigated maliciously or otherwise. No
      one knew or cared who the nobleman in question was. Razumov received a
      modest but very sufficient allowance from the hands of an obscure
      attorney, who seemed to act as his guardian in some measure. Now and then
      he appeared at some professor&rsquo;s informal reception. Apart from that
      Razumov was not known to have any social relations in the town. He
      attended the obligatory lectures regularly and was considered by the
      authorities as a very promising student. He worked at home in the manner
      of a man who means to get on, but did not shut himself up severely for
      that purpose. He was always accessible, and there was nothing secret or
      reserved in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      The origin of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s record is connected with an event
      characteristic of modern Russia in the actual fact: the assassination of a
      prominent statesman&mdash;and still more characteristic of the moral
      corruption of an oppressed society where the noblest aspirations of
      humanity, the desire of freedom, an ardent patriotism, the love of
      justice, the sense of pity, and even the fidelity of simple minds are
      prostituted to the lusts of hate and fear, the inseparable companions of
      an uneasy despotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact alluded to above is the successful attempt on the life of Mr. de
      P&mdash;-, the President of the notorious Repressive Commission of some
      years ago, the Minister of State invested with extraordinary powers. The
      newspapers made noise enough about that fanatical, narrow-chested figure
      in gold-laced uniform, with a face of crumpled parchment, insipid,
      bespectacled eyes, and the cross of the Order of St. Procopius hung under
      the skinny throat. For a time, it may be remembered, not a month passed
      without his portrait appearing in some one of the illustrated papers of
      Europe. He served the monarchy by imprisoning, exiling, or sending to the
      gallows men and women, young and old, with an equable, unwearied industry.
      In his mystic acceptance of the principle of autocracy he was bent on
      extirpating from the land every vestige of anything that resembled freedom
      in public institutions; and in his ruthless persecution of the rising
      generation he seemed to aim at the destruction of the very hope of liberty
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that this execrated personality had not enough imagination to
      be aware of the hate he inspired. It is hardly credible; but it is a fact
      that he took very few precautions for his safety. In the preamble of a
      certain famous State paper he had declared once that &ldquo;the thought of
      liberty has never existed in the Act of the Creator. From the multitude of
      men&rsquo;s counsel nothing could come but revolt and disorder; and revolt and
      disorder in a world created for obedience and stability is sin. It was not
      Reason but Authority which expressed the Divine Intention. God was the
      Autocrat of the Universe....&rdquo; It may be that the man who made this
      declaration believed that heaven itself was bound to protect him in his
      remorseless defence of Autocracy on this earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the vigilance of the police saved him many times; but, as a
      matter of fact, when his appointed fate overtook him, the competent
      authorities could not have given him any warning. They had no knowledge of
      any conspiracy against the Minister&rsquo;s life, had no hint of any plot
      through their usual channels of information, had seen no signs, were aware
      of no suspicious movements or dangerous persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. de P&mdash;- was being driven towards the railway station in a
      two-horse uncovered sleigh with footman and coachman on the box. Snow had
      been falling all night, making the roadway, uncleared as yet at this early
      hour, very heavy for the horses. It was still falling thickly. But the
      sleigh must have been observed and marked down. As it drew over to the
      left before taking a turn, the footman noticed a peasant walking slowly on
      the edge of the pavement with his hands in the pockets of his sheepskin
      coat and his shoulders hunched up to his ears under the falling snow. On
      being overtaken this peasant suddenly faced about and swung his arm. In an
      instant there was a terrible shock, a detonation muffled in the multitude
      of snowflakes; both horses lay dead and mangled on the ground and the
      coachman, with a shrill cry, had fallen off the box mortally wounded. The
      footman (who survived) had no time to see the face of the man in the
      sheepskin coat. After throwing the bomb this last got away, but it is
      supposed that, seeing a lot of people surging up on all sides of him in
      the falling snow, and all running towards the scene of the explosion, he
      thought it safer to turn back with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an incredibly short time an excited crowd assembled round the sledge.
      The Minister-President, getting out unhurt into the deep snow, stood near
      the groaning coachman and addressed the people repeatedly in his weak,
      colourless voice: &ldquo;I beg of you to keep off: For the love of God, I beg of
      you good people to keep off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then that a tall young man who had remained standing perfectly
      still within a carriage gateway, two houses lower down, stepped out into
      the street and walking up rapidly flung another bomb over the heads of the
      crowd. It actually struck the Minister-President on the shoulder as he
      stooped over his dying servant, then falling between his feet exploded
      with a terrific concentrated violence, striking him dead to the ground,
      finishing the wounded man and practically annihilating the empty sledge in
      the twinkling of an eye. With a yell of horror the crowd broke up and fled
      in all directions, except for those who fell dead or dying where they
      stood nearest to the Minister-President, and one or two others who did not
      fall till they had run a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first explosion had brought together a crowd as if by enchantment, the
      second made as swiftly a solitude in the street for hundreds of yards in
      each direction. Through the falling snow people looked from afar at the
      small heap of dead bodies lying upon each other near the carcases of the
      two horses. Nobody dared to approach till some Cossacks of a street-patrol
      galloped up and, dismounting, began to turn over the dead. Amongst the
      innocent victims of the second explosion laid out on the pavement there
      was a body dressed in a peasant&rsquo;s sheepskin coat; but the face was
      unrecognisable, there was absolutely nothing found in the pockets of its
      poor clothing, and it was the only one whose identity was never
      established.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day Mr. Razumov got up at his usual hour and spent the morning within
      the University buildings listening to the lectures and working for some
      time in the library. He heard the first vague rumour of something in the
      way of bomb-throwing at the table of the students&rsquo; ordinary, where he was
      accustomed to eat his two o&rsquo;clock dinner. But this rumour was made up of
      mere whispers, and this was Russia, where it was not always safe, for a
      student especially, to appear too much interested in certain kinds of
      whispers. Razumov was one of those men who, living in a period of mental
      and political unrest, keep an instinctive hold on normal, practical,
      everyday life. He was aware of the emotional tension of his time; he even
      responded to it in an indefinite way. But his main concern was with his
      work, his studies, and with his own future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officially and in fact without a family (for the daughter of the
      Archpriest had long been dead), no home influences had shaped his opinions
      or his feelings. He was as lonely in the world as a man swimming in the
      deep sea. The word Razumov was the mere label of a solitary individuality.
      There were no Razumovs belonging to him anywhere. His closest parentage
      was defined in the statement that he was a Russian. Whatever good he
      expected from life would be given to or withheld from his hopes by that
      connexion alone. This immense parentage suffered from the throes of
      internal dissensions, and he shrank mentally from the fray as a
      good-natured man may shrink from taking definite sides in a violent family
      quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, going home, reflected that having prepared all the matters of the
      forthcoming examination, he could now devote his time to the subject of
      the prize essay. He hankered after the silver medal. The prize was offered
      by the Ministry of Education; the names of the competitors would be
      submitted to the Minister himself. The mere fact of trying would be
      considered meritorious in the higher quarters; and the possessor of the
      prize would have a claim to an administrative appointment of the better
      sort after he had taken his degree. The student Razumov in an access of
      elation forgot the dangers menacing the stability of the institutions
      which give rewards and appointments. But remembering the medallist of the
      year before, Razumov, the young man of no parentage, was sobered. He and
      some others happened to be assembled in their comrade&rsquo;s rooms at the very
      time when that last received the official advice of his success. He was a
      quiet, unassuming young man: &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he had said with a faint
      apologetic smile and taking up his cap, &ldquo;I am going out to order up some
      wine. But I must first send a telegram to my folk at home. I say! Won&rsquo;t
      the old people make it a festive time for the neighbours for twenty miles
      around our place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov thought there was nothing of that sort for him in the world. His
      success would matter to no one. But he felt no bitterness against the
      nobleman his protector, who was not a provincial magnate as was generally
      supposed. He was in fact nobody less than Prince K&mdash;-, once a great
      and splendid figure in the world and now, his day being over, a Senator
      and a gouty invalid, living in a still splendid but more domestic manner.
      He had some young children and a wife as aristocratic and proud as
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all his life Razumov was allowed only once to come into personal
      contact with the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had the air of a chance meeting in the little attorney&rsquo;s office. One
      day Razumov, coming in by appointment, found a stranger standing there&mdash;a
      tall, aristocratic-looking Personage with silky, grey sidewhiskers. The
      bald-headed, sly little lawyer-fellow called out, &ldquo;Come in&mdash;come in,
      Mr. Razumov,&rdquo; with a sort of ironic heartiness. Then turning deferentially
      to the stranger with the grand air, &ldquo;A ward of mine, your Excellency. One
      of the most promising students of his faculty in the St. Petersburg
      University.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his intense surprise Razumov saw a white shapely hand extended to him.
      He took it in great confusion (it was soft and passive) and heard at the
      same time a condescending murmur in which he caught only the words
      &ldquo;Satisfactory&rdquo; and &ldquo;Persevere.&rdquo; But the most amazing thing of all was to
      feel suddenly a distinct pressure of the white shapely hand just before it
      was withdrawn: a light pressure like a secret sign. The emotion of it was
      terrible. Razumov&rsquo;s heart seemed to leap into his throat. When he raised
      his eyes the aristocratic personage, motioning the little lawyer aside,
      had opened the door and was going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attorney rummaged amongst the papers on his desk for a time. &ldquo;Do you
      know who that was?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, whose heart was thumping hard yet, shook his head in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Prince K&mdash;-. You wonder what he could be doing in the hole
      of a poor legal rat like myself&mdash;eh? These awfully great people have
      their sentimental curiosities like common sinners. But if I were you,
      Kirylo Sidorovitch,&rdquo; he continued, leering and laying a peculiar emphasis
      on the patronymic, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t boast at large of the introduction. It
      would not be prudent, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Oh dear no! It would be in fact
      dangerous for your future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s ears burned like fire; his sight was dim. &ldquo;That man!&rdquo;
       Razumov was saying to himself. &ldquo;He!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth it was by this monosyllable that Mr. Razumov got into the habit
      of referring mentally to the stranger with grey silky side-whiskers. From
      that time too, when walking in the more fashionable quarters, he noted
      with interest the magnificent horses and carriages with Prince K&mdash;-&rsquo;s
      liveries on the box. Once he saw the Princess get out&mdash;she was
      shopping&mdash;followed by two girls, of which one was nearly a head
      taller than the other. Their fair hair hung loose down their backs in the
      English style; they had merry eyes, their coats, muffs, and little fur
      caps were exactly alike, and their cheeks and noses were tinged a cheerful
      pink by the frost. They crossed the pavement in front of him, and Razumov
      went on his way smiling shyly to himself. &ldquo;His&rdquo; daughters. They resembled
      &ldquo;Him.&rdquo; The young man felt a glow of warm friendliness towards these girls
      who would never know of his existence. Presently they would marry Generals
      or Kammerherrs and have girls and boys of their own, who perhaps would be
      aware of him as a celebrated old professor, decorated, possibly a Privy
      Councillor, one of the glories of Russia&mdash;nothing more!
    </p>
    <p>
      But a celebrated professor was a somebody. Distinction would convert the
      label Razumov into an honoured name. There was nothing strange in the
      student Razumov&rsquo;s wish for distinction. A man&rsquo;s real life is that accorded
      to him in the thoughts of other men by reason of respect or natural love.
      Returning home on the day of the attempt on Mr. de P&mdash;-&rsquo;s life
      Razumov resolved to have a good try for the silver medal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Climbing slowly the four flights of the dark, dirty staircase in the house
      where he had his lodgings, he felt confident of success. The winner&rsquo;s name
      would be published in the papers on New Year&rsquo;s Day. And at the thought
      that &ldquo;He&rdquo; would most probably read it there, Razumov stopped short on the
      stairs for an instant, then went on smiling faintly at his own emotion.
      &ldquo;This is but a shadow,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;but the medal is a solid
      beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those ideas of industry in his head the warmth of his room was
      agreeable and encouraging. &ldquo;I shall put in four hours of good work,&rdquo; he
      thought. But no sooner had he closed the door than he was horribly
      startled. All black against the usual tall stove of white tiles gleaming
      in the dusk, stood a strange figure, wearing a skirted, close-fitting,
      brown cloth coat strapped round the waist, in long boots, and with a
      little Astrakhan cap on its head. It loomed lithe and martial. Razumov was
      utterly confounded. It was only when the figure advancing two paces asked
      in an untroubled, grave voice if the outer door was closed that he
      regained his power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haldin!... Victor Victorovitch!... Is that you?... Yes. The outer door is
      shut all right. But this is indeed unexpected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Victor Haldin, a student older than most of his contemporaries at the
      University, was not one of the industrious set. He was hardly ever seen at
      lectures; the authorities had marked him as &ldquo;restless&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsound &ldquo;&mdash;very
      bad notes. But he had a great personal prestige with his comrades and
      influenced their thoughts. Razumov had never been intimate with him. They
      had met from time to time at gatherings in other students&rsquo; houses. They
      had even had a discussion together&mdash;one of those discussions on first
      principles dear to the sanguine minds of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov wished the man had chosen some other time to come for a chat. He
      felt in good trim to tackle the prize essay. But as Haldin could not be
      slightingly dismissed Razumov adopted the tone of hospitality, asking him
      to sit down and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirylo Sidorovitch,&rdquo; said the other, flinging off his cap, &ldquo;we are not
      perhaps in exactly the same camp. Your judgment is more philosophical. You
      are a man of few words, but I haven&rsquo;t met anybody who dared to doubt the
      generosity of your sentiments. There is a solidity about your character
      which cannot exist without courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov felt flattered and began to murmur shyly something about being
      very glad of his good opinion, when Haldin raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I was saying to myself,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;as I dodged in the
      woodyard down by the river-side. &lsquo;He has a strong character this young
      man,&rsquo; I said to myself. &lsquo;He does not throw his soul to the winds.&rsquo; Your
      reserve has always fascinated me, Kirylo Sidorovitch. So I tried to
      remember your address. But look here&mdash;it was a piece of luck. Your
      dvornik was away from the gate talking to a sleigh-driver on the other
      side of the street. I met no one on the stairs, not a soul. As I came up
      to your floor I caught sight of your landlady coming out of your rooms.
      But she did not see me. She crossed the landing to her own side, and then
      I slipped in. I have been here two hours expecting you to come in every
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had listened in astonishment; but before he could open his mouth
      Haldin added, speaking deliberately, &ldquo;It was I who removed de P&mdash;-
      this morning.&rdquo; Razumov kept down a cry of dismay. The sentiment of his
      life being utterly ruined by this contact with such a crime expressed
      itself quaintly by a sort of half-derisive mental exclamation, &ldquo;There goes
      my silver medal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haldin continued after waiting a while&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say nothing, Kirylo Sidorovitch! I understand your silence. To be
      sure, I cannot expect you with your frigid English manner to embrace me.
      But never mind your manners. You have enough heart to have heard the sound
      of weeping and gnashing of teeth this man raised in the land. That would
      be enough to get over any philosophical hopes. He was uprooting the tender
      plant. He had to be stopped. He was a dangerous man&mdash;a convinced man.
      Three more years of his work would have put us back fifty years into
      bondage&mdash;and look at all the lives wasted, at all the souls lost in
      that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His curt, self-confident voice suddenly lost its ring and it was in a dull
      tone that he added, &ldquo;Yes, brother, I have killed him. It&rsquo;s weary work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had sunk into a chair. Every moment he expected a crowd of
      policemen to rush in. There must have been thousands of them out looking
      for that man walking up and down in his room. Haldin was talking again in
      a restrained, steady voice. Now and then he flourished an arm, slowly,
      without excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Razumov how he had brooded for a year; how he had not slept
      properly for weeks. He and &ldquo;Another&rdquo; had a warning of the Minister&rsquo;s
      movements from &ldquo;a certain person&rdquo; late the evening before. He and that
      &ldquo;Another&rdquo; prepared their &ldquo;engines&rdquo; and resolved to have no sleep till &ldquo;the
      deed&rdquo; was done. They walked the streets under the falling snow with the
      &ldquo;engines&rdquo; on them, exchanging not a word the livelong night. When they
      happened to meet a police patrol they took each other by the arm and
      pretended to be a couple of peasants on the spree. They reeled and talked
      in drunken hoarse voices. Except for these strange outbreaks they kept
      silence, moving on ceaselessly. Their plans had been previously arranged.
      At daybreak they made their way to the spot which they knew the sledge
      must pass. When it appeared in sight they exchanged a muttered good-bye
      and separated. The &ldquo;other&rdquo; remained at the corner, Haldin took up a
      position a little farther up the street....
    </p>
    <p>
      After throwing his &ldquo;engine&rdquo; he ran off and in a moment was overtaken by
      the panic-struck people flying away from the spot after the second
      explosion. They were wild with terror. He was jostled once or twice. He
      slowed down for the rush to pass him and then turned to the left into a
      narrow street. There he was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He marvelled at this immediate escape. The work was done. He could hardly
      believe it. He fought with an almost irresistible longing to lie down on
      the pavement and sleep. But this sort of faintness&mdash;a drowsy
      faintness&mdash;passed off quickly. He walked faster, making his way to
      one of the poorer parts of the town in order to look up Ziemianitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Ziemianitch, Razumov understood, was a sort of town-peasant who had
      got on; owner of a small number of sledges and horses for hire. Haldin
      paused in his narrative to exclaim&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bright spirit! A hardy soul! The best driver in St. Petersburg. He has
      a team of three horses there.... Ah! He&rsquo;s a fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This man had declared himself willing to take out safely, at any time, one
      or two persons to the second or third railway station on one of the
      southern lines. But there had been no time to warn him the night before.
      His usual haunt seemed to be a low-class eating-house on the outskirts of
      the town. When Haldin got there the man was not to be found. He was not
      expected to turn up again till the evening. Haldin wandered away
      restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the gate of a woodyard open and went in to get out of the wind
      which swept the bleak broad thoroughfare. The great rectangular piles of
      cut wood loaded with snow resembled the huts of a village. At first the
      watchman who discovered him crouching amongst them talked in a friendly
      manner. He was a dried-up old man wearing two ragged army coats one over
      the other; his wizened little face, tied up under the jaw and over the
      ears in a dirty red handkerchief, looked comical. Presently he grew sulky,
      and then all at once without rhyme or reason began to shout furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ever going to clear out of this, you loafer? We know all about
      factory hands of your sort. A big, strong, young chap! You aren&rsquo;t even
      drunk. What do you want here? You don&rsquo;t frighten us. Take yourself and
      your ugly eyes away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haldin stopped before the sitting Razumov. His supple figure, with the
      white forehead above which the fair hair stood straight up, had an aspect
      of lofty daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not like my eyes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And so...here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov made an effort to speak calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But pardon me, Victor Victorovitch. We know each other so little.... I
      don&rsquo;t see why you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confidence,&rdquo; said Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This word sealed Razumov&rsquo;s lips as if a hand had been clapped on his
      mouth. His brain seethed with arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so&mdash;here you are,&rdquo; he muttered through his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other did not detect the tone of anger. Never suspected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And nobody knows I am here. You are the last person that could be
      suspected&mdash;should I get caught. That&rsquo;s an advantage, you see. And
      then&mdash;speaking to a superior mind like yours I can well say all the
      truth. It occurred to me that you&mdash;you have no one belonging to you&mdash;no
      ties, no one to suffer for it if this came out by some means. There have
      been enough ruined Russian homes as it is. But I don&rsquo;t see how my passage
      through your rooms can be ever known. If I should be got hold of, I&rsquo;ll
      know how to keep silent&mdash;no matter what they may be pleased to do to
      me,&rdquo; he added grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to walk again while Razumov sat still appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought that&mdash;&rdquo; he faltered out almost sick with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Razumov. Yes, brother. Some day you shall help to build. You suppose
      that I am a terrorist, now&mdash;a destructor of what is, But consider
      that the true destroyers are they who destroy the spirit of progress and
      truth, not the avengers who merely kill the bodies of the persecutors of
      human dignity. Men like me are necessary to make room for self-contained,
      thinking men like you. Well, we have made the sacrifice of our lives, but
      all the same I want to escape if it can be done. It is not my life I want
      to save, but my power to do. I won&rsquo;t live idle. Oh no! Don&rsquo;t make any
      mistake, Razumov. Men like me are rare. And, besides, an example like this
      is more awful to oppressors when the perpetrator vanishes without a trace.
      They sit in their offices and palaces and quake. All I want you to do is
      to help me to vanish. No great matter that. Only to go by and by and see
      Ziemianitch for me at that place where I went this morning. Just tell him,
      &lsquo;He whom you know wants a well-horsed sledge to pull up half an hour after
      midnight at the seventh lamp-post on the left counting from the upper end
      of Karabelnaya. If nobody gets in, the sledge is to run round a block or
      two, so as to come back past the same spot in ten minutes&rsquo; time.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov wondered why he had not cut short that talk and told this man to
      go away long before. Was it weakness or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      He concluded that it was a sound instinct. Haldin must have been seen. It
      was impossible that some people should not have noticed the face and
      appearance of the man who threw the second bomb. Haldin was a noticeable
      person. The police in their thousands must have had his description within
      the hour. With every moment the danger grew. Sent out to wander in the
      streets he could not escape being caught in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police would very soon find out all about him. They would set about
      discovering a conspiracy. Everybody Haldin had ever known would be in the
      greatest danger. Unguarded expressions, little facts in themselves
      innocent would be counted for crimes. Razumov remembered certain words he
      said, the speeches he had listened to, the harmless gatherings he had
      attended&mdash;it was almost impossible for a student to keep out of that
      sort of thing, without becoming suspect to his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov saw himself shut up in a fortress, worried, badgered, perhaps
      ill-used. He saw himself deported by an administrative order, his life
      broken, ruined, and robbed of all hope. He saw himself&mdash;at best&mdash;leading
      a miserable existence under police supervision, in some small, faraway
      provincial town, without friends to assist his necessities or even take
      any steps to alleviate his lot&mdash;as others had. Others had fathers,
      mothers, brothers, relations, connexions, to move heaven and earth on
      their behalf&mdash;he had no one. The very officials that sentenced him
      some morning would forget his existence before sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his youth pass away from him in misery and half starvation&mdash;his
      strength give way, his mind become an abject thing. He saw himself
      creeping, broken down and shabby, about the streets&mdash;dying unattended
      in some filthy hole of a room, or on the sordid bed of a Government
      hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered. Then the peace of bitter calmness came over him. It was best
      to keep this man out of the streets till he could be got rid of with some
      chance of escaping. That was the best that could be done. Razumov, of
      course, felt the safety of his lonely existence to be permanently
      endangered. This evening&rsquo;s doings could turn up against him at any time as
      long as this man lived and the present institutions endured. They appeared
      to him rational and indestructible at that moment. They had a force of
      harmony&mdash;in contrast with the horrible discord of this man&rsquo;s
      presence. He hated the man. He said quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, I will go. &lsquo;You must give me precise directions, and for
      the rest&mdash;depend on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You are a fellow! Collected&mdash;cool as a cucumber. A regular
      Englishman. Where did you get your soul from? There aren&rsquo;t many like you.
      Look here, brother! Men like me leave no posterity, but their souls are
      not lost. No man&rsquo;s soul is ever lost. It works for itself&mdash;or else
      where would be the sense of self-sacrifice, of martyrdom, of conviction,
      of faith&mdash;the labours of the soul? What will become of my soul when I
      die in the way I must die&mdash;soon&mdash;very soon perhaps? It shall not
      perish. Don&rsquo;t make a mistake, Razumov. This is not murder&mdash;it is war,
      war. My spirit shall go on warring in some Russian body till all falsehood
      is swept out of the world. The modern civilization is false, but a new
      revelation shall come out of Russia. Ha! you say nothing. You are a
      sceptic. I respect your philosophical scepticism, Razumov, but don&rsquo;t touch
      the soul. The Russian soul that lives in all of us. It has a future. It
      has a mission, I tell you, or else why should I have been moved to do this&mdash;reckless&mdash;like
      a butcher&mdash;in the middle of all these innocent people&mdash;scattering
      death&mdash;I! I!... I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so loud,&rdquo; warned Razumov harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldin sat down abruptly, and leaning his head on his folded arms burst
      into tears. He wept for a long time. The dusk had deepened in the room.
      Razumov, motionless in sombre wonder, listened to the sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other raised his head, got up and with an effort mastered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Men like me leave no posterity,&rdquo; he repeated in a subdued tone, &ldquo;I
      have a sister though. She&rsquo;s with my old mother&mdash;I persuaded them to
      go abroad this year&mdash;thank God. Not a bad little girl my sister. She
      has the most trustful eyes of any human being that ever walked this earth.
      She will marry well, I hope. She may have children&mdash;sons perhaps.
      Look at me. My father was a Government official in the provinces, He had a
      little land too. A simple servant of God&mdash;a true Russian in his way.
      His was the soul of obedience. But I am not like him. They say I resemble
      my mother&rsquo;s eldest brother, an officer. They shot him in &lsquo;28. Under
      Nicholas, you know. Haven&rsquo;t I told you that this is war, war.... But God
      of Justice! This is weary work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, in his chair, leaning his head on his hand, spoke as if from the
      bottom of an abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe in God, Haldin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go catching at words that are wrung from one. What does it
      matter? What was it the Englishman said: &lsquo;There is a divine soul in
      things...&rsquo; Devil take him&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember now. But he spoke the
      truth. When the day of you thinkers comes don&rsquo;t you forget what&rsquo;s divine
      in the Russian soul&mdash;and that&rsquo;s resignation. Respect that in your
      intellectual restlessness and don&rsquo;t let your arrogant wisdom spoil its
      message to the world. I am speaking to you now like a man with a rope
      round his neck. What do you imagine I am? A being in revolt? No. It&rsquo;s you
      thinkers who are in everlasting revolt. I am one of the resigned. When the
      necessity of this heavy work came to me and I understood that it had to be
      done&mdash;what did I do? Did I exult? Did I take pride in my purpose? Did
      I try to weigh its worth and consequences? No! I was resigned. I thought
      &lsquo;God&rsquo;s will be done.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself full length on Razumov&rsquo;s bed and putting the backs of his
      hands over his eyes remained perfectly motionless and silent. Not even the
      sound of his breathing could be heard. The dead stillness or the room
      remained undisturbed till in the darkness Razumov said gloomily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haldin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the other readily, quite invisible now on the bed and
      without the slightest stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time for me to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, brother.&rdquo; The other was heard, lying still in the darkness as though
      he were talking in his sleep. &ldquo;The time has come to put fate to the test.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, then gave a few lucid directions in the quiet impersonal voice
      of a man in a trance. Razumov made ready without a word of answer. As he
      was leaving the room the voice on the bed said after him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with God, thou silent soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the landing, moving softly, Razumov locked the door and put the key in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      The words and events of that evening must have been graven as if with a
      steel tool on Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s brain since he was able to write his relation
      with such fullness and precision a good many months afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record of the thoughts which assailed him in the street is even more
      minute and abundant. They seem to have rushed upon him with the greater
      freedom because his thinking powers were no longer crushed by Haldin&rsquo;s
      presence&mdash;the appalling presence of a great crime and the stunning
      force of a great fanaticism. On looking through the pages of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s
      diary I own that a &ldquo;rush of thoughts&rdquo; is not an adequate image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more adequate description would be a tumult of thoughts&mdash;the
      faithful reflection of the state of his feelings. The thoughts in
      themselves were not numerous&mdash;they were like the thoughts of most
      human beings, few and simple&mdash;but they cannot be reproduced here in
      all their exclamatory repetitions which went on in an endless and weary
      turmoil&mdash;for the walk was long.
    </p>
    <p>
      If to the Western reader they appear shocking, inappropriate, or even
      improper, it must be remembered that as to the first this may be the
      effect of my crude statement. For the rest I will only remark here that
      this is not a story of the West of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nations it may be have fashioned their Governments, but the Governments
      have paid them back in the same coin. It is unthinkable that any young
      Englishman should find himself in Razumov&rsquo;s situation. This being so it
      would be a vain enterprise to imagine what he would think. The only safe
      surmise to make is that he would not think as Mr. Razumov thought at this
      crisis of his fate. He would not have an hereditary and personal knowledge
      or the means by which historical autocracy represses ideas, guards its
      power, and defends its existence. By an act of mental extravagance he
      might imagine himself arbitrarily thrown into prison, but it would never
      occur to him unless he were delirious (and perhaps not even then) that he
      could be beaten with whips as a practical measure either of investigation
      or of punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is but a crude and obvious example of the different conditions of
      Western thought. I don&rsquo;t know that this danger occurred, specially, to Mr.
      Razumov. No doubt it entered unconsciously into the general dread and the
      general appallingness of this crisis. Razumov, as has been seen, was aware
      of more subtle ways in which an individual may be undone by the
      proceedings of a despotic Government. A simple expulsion from the
      University (the very least that could happen to him), with an
      impossibility to continue his studies anywhere, was enough to ruin utterly
      a young man depending entirely upon the development of his natural
      abilities for his place in the world. He was a Russian: and for him to be
      implicated meant simply sinking into the lowest social depths amongst the
      hopeless and the destitute&mdash;the night birds of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar circumstances of Razumov&rsquo;s parentage, or rather of his lack
      of parentage, should be taken into the account of his thoughts. And he
      remembered them too. He had been lately reminded of them in a peculiarly
      atrocious way by this fatal Haldin. &ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t that, must
      everything else be taken away from me?&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nerved himself for another effort to go on. Along the roadway sledges
      glided phantom-like and jingling through a fluttering whiteness on the
      black face of the night. &ldquo;For it is a crime,&rdquo; he was saying to himself. &ldquo;A
      murder is a murder. Though, of course, some sort of liberal
      institutions....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of horrible sickness came over him. &ldquo;I must be courageous,&rdquo; he
      exhorted himself mentally. All his strength was suddenly gone as if taken
      out by a hand. Then by a mighty effort of will it came back because he was
      afraid of fainting in the street and being picked up by the police with
      the key of his lodgings in his pocket. They would find Haldin there, and
      then, indeed, he would be undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough it was this fear which seems to have kept him up to the
      end. The passers-by were rare. They came upon him suddenly, looming up
      black in the snowflakes close by, then vanishing all at once-without
      footfalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the quarter of the very poor. Razumov noticed an elderly woman tied
      up in ragged shawls. Under the street lamp she seemed a beggar off duty.
      She walked leisurely in the blizzard as though she had no home to hurry
      to, she hugged under one arm a round loaf of black bread with an air of
      guarding a priceless booty: and Razumov averting his glance envied her the
      peace of her mind and the serenity of her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To one reading Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s narrative it is really a wonder how he
      managed to keep going as he did along one interminable street after
      another on pavements that were gradually becoming blocked with snow. It
      was the thought of Haldin locked up in his rooms and the desperate desire
      to get rid of his presence which drove him forward. No rational
      determination had any part in his exertions. Thus, when on arriving at the
      low eating-house he heard that the man of horses, Ziemianitch, was not
      there, he could only stare stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter, a wild-haired youth in tarred boots and a pink shirt,
      exclaimed, uncovering his pale gums in a silly grin, that Ziemianitch had
      got his skinful early in the afternoon and had gone away with a bottle
      under each arm to keep it up amongst the horses&mdash;he supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the vile den, a bony short man in a dirty cloth caftan coming
      down to his heels, stood by, his hands tucked into his belt, and nodded
      confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reek of spirits, the greasy rancid steam of food got Razumov by the
      throat. He struck a table with his clenched hand and shouted violently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bleary unwashed faces were turned to his direction. A mild-eyed ragged
      tramp drinking tea at the next table moved farther away. A murmur of
      wonder arose with an undertone of uneasiness. A laugh was heard too, and
      an exclamation, &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; jeeringly soothing. The waiter looked all
      round and announced to the room&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman won&rsquo;t believe that Ziemianitch is drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From a distant corner a hoarse voice belonging to a horrible, nondescript,
      shaggy being with a black face like the muzzle of a bear grunted angrily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cursed driver of thieves. What do we want with his gentlemen here? We
      are all honest folk in this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, biting his lip till blood came to keep himself from bursting into
      imprecations, followed the owner of the den, who, whispering &ldquo;Come along,
      little father,&rdquo; led him into a tiny hole of a place behind the wooden
      counter, whence proceeded a sound of splashing. A wet and bedraggled
      creature, a sort of sexless and shivering scarecrow, washed glasses in
      there, bending over a wooden tub by the light of a tallow dip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, little father,&rdquo; the man in the long caftan said plaintively. He had
      a brown, cunning little face, a thin greyish beard. Trying to light a tin
      lantern he hugged it to his breast and talked garrulously the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would show Ziemianitch to the gentleman to prove there were no lies
      told. And he would show him drunk. His woman, it seems, ran away from him
      last night. &ldquo;Such a hag she was! Thin! Pfui!&rdquo; He spat. They were always
      running away from that driver of the devil&mdash;and he sixty years old
      too; could never get used to it. But each heart knows sorrow after its own
      kind and Ziemianitch was a born fool all his days. And then he would fly
      to the bottle. &ldquo;&lsquo;Who could bear life in our land without the bottle?&rsquo; he
      says. A proper Russian man&mdash;the little pig.... Be pleased to follow
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov crossed a quadrangle of deep snow enclosed between high walls with
      innumerable windows. Here and there a dim yellow light hung within the
      four-square mass of darkness. The house was an enormous slum, a hive of
      human vermin, a monumental abode of misery towering on the verge of
      starvation and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner the ground sloped sharply down, and Razumov followed the light
      of the lantern through a small doorway into a long cavernous place like a
      neglected subterranean byre. Deep within, three shaggy little horses tied
      up to rings hung their heads together, motionless and shadowy in the dim
      light of the lantern. It must have been the famous team of Haldin&rsquo;s
      escape. Razumov peered fearfully into the gloom. His guide pawed in the
      straw with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is. Ah! the little pigeon. A true Russian man. &lsquo;No heavy hearts
      for me,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Bring out the bottle and take your ugly mug out of my
      sight.&rsquo; Ha! ha! ha! That&rsquo;s the fellow he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held the lantern over a prone form of a man, apparently fully dressed
      for outdoors. His head was lost in a pointed cloth hood. On the other side
      of a heap of straw protruded a pair of feet in monstrous thick boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always ready to drive,&rdquo; commented the keeper of the eating-house. &ldquo;A
      proper Russian driver that. Saint or devil, night or day is all one to
      Ziemianitch when his heart is free from sorrow. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t ask who you are,
      but where you want to go,&rsquo; he says. He would drive Satan himself to his
      own abode and come back chirruping to his horses. Many a one he has driven
      who is clanking his chains in the Nertchinsk mines by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him, wake him up,&rdquo; he faltered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other set down his light, stepped back and launched a kick at the
      prostrate sleeper. The man shook at the impact but did not move. At the
      third kick he grunted but remained inert as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eating-house keeper desisted and fetched a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see for yourself how it is. We have done what we can for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the lantern. The intense black spokes of shadow swung about
      in the circle of light. A terrible fury&mdash;the blind rage of
      self-preservation&mdash;possessed Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! The vile beast,&rdquo; he bellowed out in an unearthly tone which made the
      lantern jump and tremble! &ldquo;I shall wake you! Give me...give me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round wildly, seized the handle of a stablefork and rushing
      forward struck at the prostrate body with inarticulate cries. After a time
      his cries ceased, and the rain of blows fell in the stillness and shadows
      of the cellar-like stable. Razumov belaboured Ziemianitch with an
      insatiable fury, in great volleys of sounding thwacks. Except for the
      violent movements of Razumov nothing stirred, neither the beaten man nor
      the spoke-like shadows on the walls. And only the sound of blows was
      heard. It was a weird scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was a sharp crack. The stick broke and half of it flew far
      away into the gloom beyond the light. At the same time Ziemianitch sat up.
      At this Razumov became as motionless as the man with the lantern&mdash;only
      his breast heaved for air as if ready to burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some dull sensation of pain must have penetrated at last the consoling
      night of drunkenness enwrapping the &ldquo;bright Russian soul&rdquo; of Haldin&rsquo;s
      enthusiastic praise. But Ziemianitch evidently saw nothing. His eyeballs
      blinked all white in the light once, twice&mdash;then the gleam went out.
      For a moment he sat in the straw with closed eyes with a strange air of
      weary meditation, then fell over slowly on his side without making the
      slightest sound. Only the straw rustled a little. Razumov stared wildly,
      fighting for his breath. After a second or two he heard a light snore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung from him the piece of stick remaining in his grasp, and went off
      with great hasty strides without looking back once.
    </p>
    <p>
      After going heedlessly for some fifty yards along the street he walked
      into a snowdrift and was up to his knees before he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      This recalled him to himself; and glancing about he discovered he had been
      going in the wrong direction. He retraced his steps, but now at a more
      moderate pace. When passing before the house he had just left he
      flourished his fist at the sombre refuge of misery and crime rearing its
      sinister bulk on the white ground. It had an air of brooding. He let his
      arm fall by his side&mdash;discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ziemianitch&rsquo;s passionate surrender to sorrow and consolation had baffled
      him. That was the people. A true Russian man! Razumov was glad he had
      beaten that brute&mdash;the &ldquo;bright soul&rdquo; of the other. Here they were:
      the people and the enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the two he was done for. Between the drunkenness of the peasant
      incapable of action and the dream-intoxication of the idealist incapable
      of perceiving the reason of things, and the true character of men. It was
      a sort of terrible childishness. But children had their masters. &ldquo;Ah! the
      stick, the stick, the stern hand,&rdquo; thought Razumov, longing for power to
      hurt and destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad he had thrashed that brute. The physical exertion had left his
      body in a comfortable glow. His mental agitation too was clarified as if
      all the feverishness had gone out of him in a fit of outward violence.
      Together with the persisting sense of terrible danger he was conscious now
      of a tranquil, unquenchable hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slower and slower. And indeed, considering the guest he had in
      his rooms, it was no wonder he lingered on the way. It was like harbouring
      a pestilential disease that would not perhaps take your life, but would
      take from you all that made life worth living&mdash;a subtle pest that
      would convert earth into a hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he doing now? Lying on the bed as if dead, with the back of his
      hands over his eyes? Razumov had a morbidly vivid vision of Haldin on his
      bed&mdash;the white pillow hollowed by the head, the legs in long boots,
      the upturned feet. And in his abhorrence he said to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill
      him when I get home.&rdquo; But he knew very well that that was of no use. The
      corpse hanging round his neck would be nearly as fatal as the living man.
      Nothing short of complete annihilation would do. And that was impossible.
      What then? Must one kill oneself to escape this visitation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov&rsquo;s despair was too profoundly tinged with hate to accept that
      issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was despair&mdash;nothing less&mdash;at the thought of having
      to live with Haldin for an indefinite number of days in mortal alarm at
      every sound. But perhaps when he heard that this &ldquo;bright soul&rdquo; of
      Ziemianitch suffered from a drunken eclipse the fellow would take his
      infernal resignation somewhere else. And that was not likely on the face
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov thought: &ldquo;I am being crushed&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t even run away.&rdquo;
       Other men had somewhere a corner of the earth&mdash;some little house in
      the provinces where they had a right to take their troubles. A material
      refuge. He had nothing. He had not even a moral refuge&mdash;the refuge of
      confidence. To whom could he go with this tale&mdash;in all this great,
      great land?
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov stamped his foot&mdash;and under the soft carpet of snow felt the
      hard ground of Russia, inanimate, cold, inert, like a sullen and tragic
      mother hiding her face under a winding-sheet&mdash;his native soil!&mdash;his
      very own&mdash;without a fireside, without a heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast his eyes upwards and stood amazed. The snow had ceased to fall,
      and now, as if by a miracle, he saw above his head the clear black sky of
      the northern winter, decorated with the sumptuous fires of the stars. It
      was a canopy fit for the resplendent purity of the snows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov received an almost physical impression of endless space and of
      countless millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He responded to it with the readiness of a Russian who is born to an
      inheritance of space and numbers. Under the sumptuous immensity of the
      sky, the snow covered the endless forests, the frozen rivers, the plains
      of an immense country, obliterating the landmarks, the accidents of the
      ground, levelling everything under its uniform whiteness, like a monstrous
      blank page awaiting the record of an inconceivable history. It covered the
      passive land with its lives of countless people like Ziemianitch and its
      handful of agitators like this Haldin&mdash;murdering foolishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sort of sacred inertia. Razumov felt a respect for it. A voice
      seemed to cry within him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch it.&rdquo; It was a guarantee of
      duration, of safety, while the travail of maturing destiny went on&mdash;a
      work not of revolutions with their passionate levity of action and their
      shifting impulses&mdash;but of peace. What it needed was not the
      conflicting aspirations of a people, but a will strong and one: it wanted
      not the babble of many voices, but a man&mdash;strong and one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov stood on the point of conversion. He was fascinated by its
      approach, by its overpowering logic. For a train of thought is never
      false. The falsehood lies deep in the necessities of existence, in secret
      fears and half-formed ambitions, in the secret confidence combined with a
      secret mistrust of ourselves, in the love of hope and the dread of
      uncertain days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Russia, the land of spectral ideas and disembodied aspirations, many
      brave minds have turned away at last from the vain and endless conflict to
      the one great historical fact of the land. They turned to autocracy for
      the peace of their patriotic conscience as a weary unbeliever, touched by
      grace, turns to the faith of his fathers for the blessing of spiritual
      rest. Like other Russians before him, Razumov, in conflict with himself,
      felt the touch of grace upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haldin means disruption,&rdquo; he thought to himself, beginning to walk again.
      &ldquo;What is he with his indignation, with his talk of bondage&mdash;with his
      talk of God&rsquo;s justice? All that means disruption. Better that thousands
      should suffer than that a people should become a disintegrated mass,
      helpless like dust in the wind. Obscurantism is better than the light of
      incendiary torches. The seed germinates in the night. Out of the dark soil
      springs the perfect plant. But a volcanic eruption is sterile, the ruin of
      the fertile ground. And am I, who love my country&mdash;who have nothing
      but that to love and put my faith in&mdash;am I to have my future, perhaps
      my usefulness, ruined by this sanguinary fanatic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grace entered into Razumov. He believed now in the man who would come
      at the appointed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a throne? A few pieces of wood upholstered in velvet. But a throne
      is a seat of power too. The form of government is the shape of a tool&mdash;an
      instrument. But twenty thousand bladders inflated by the noblest
      sentiments and jostling against each other in the air are a miserable
      incumbrance of space, holding no power, possessing no will, having nothing
      to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on thus, heedless of the way, holding a discourse with himself
      with extraordinary abundance and facility. Generally his phrases came to
      him slowly, after a conscious and painstaking wooing. Some superior power
      had inspired him with a flow of masterly argument as certain converted
      sinners become overwhelmingly loquacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt an austere exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the luridly smoky lucubrations of that fellow to the clear grasp
      of my intellect?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Is not this my country? Have I not got
      forty million brothers?&rdquo; he asked himself, unanswerably victorious in the
      silence of his breast. And the fearful thrashing he had given the
      inanimate Ziemianitch seemed to him a sign of intimate union, a
      pathetically severe necessity of brotherly love. &ldquo;No! If I must suffer let
      me at least suffer for my convictions, not for a crime my reason&mdash;my
      cool superior reason&mdash;rejects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased to think for a moment. The silence in his breast was complete.
      But he felt a suspicious uneasiness, such as we may experience when we
      enter an unlighted strange place&mdash;the irrational feeling that
      something may jump upon us in the dark&mdash;the absurd dread of the
      unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he was far from being a moss-grown reactionary. Everything was
      not for the best. Despotic bureaucracy... abuses... corruption... and so
      on. Capable men were wanted. Enlightened intelligences. Devoted hearts.
      But absolute power should be preserved&mdash;the tool ready for the man&mdash;for
      the great autocrat of the future. Razumov believed in him. The logic of
      history made him unavoidable. The state of the people demanded him, &ldquo;What
      else?&rdquo; he asked himself ardently, &ldquo;could move all that mass in one
      direction? Nothing could. Nothing but a single will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was persuaded that he was sacrificing his personal longings of
      liberalism&mdash;rejecting the attractive error for the stern Russian
      truth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s patriotism,&rdquo; he observed mentally, and added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
      stopping midway on that road,&rdquo; and then remarked to himself, &ldquo;I am not a
      coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again there was a dead silence in Razumov&rsquo;s breast. He walked with
      lowered head, making room for no one. He walked slowly and his thoughts
      returning spoke within him with solemn slowness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this Haldin? And what am I? Only two grains of sand. But a great
      mountain is made up of just such insignificant grains. And the death of a
      man or of many men is an insignificant thing. Yet we combat a contagious
      pestilence. Do I want his death? No! I would save him if I could&mdash;but
      no one can do that&mdash;he is the withered member which must be cut off.
      If I must perish through him, let me at least not perish with him, and
      associated against my will with his sombre folly that understands nothing
      either of men or things. Why should I leave a false memory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It passed through his mind that there was no one in the world who cared
      what sort of memory he left behind him. He exclaimed to himself instantly,
      &ldquo;Perish vainly for a falsehood!... What a miserable fate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was now in a more animated part of the town. He did not remark the
      crash of two colliding sledges close to the curb. The driver of one
      bellowed tearfully at his fellow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thou vile wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This hoarse yell, let out nearly in his ear, disturbed Razumov. He shook
      his head impatiently and went on looking straight before him. Suddenly on
      the snow, stretched on his back right across his path, he saw Haldin,
      solid, distinct, real, with his inverted hands over his eyes, clad in a
      brown close-fitting coat and long boots. He was lying out of the way a
      little, as though he had selected that place on purpose. The snow round
      him was untrodden.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hallucination had such a solidity of aspect that the first movement
      of Razumov was to reach for his pocket to assure himself that the key of
      his rooms was there. But he checked the impulse with a disdainful curve of
      his lips. He understood. His thought, concentrated intensely on the figure
      left lying on his bed, had culminated in this extraordinary illusion of
      the sight. Razumov tackled the phenomenon calmly. With a stern face,
      without a check and gazing far beyond the vision, he walked on,
      experiencing nothing but a slight tightening of the chest. After passing
      he turned his head for a glance, and saw only the unbroken track of his
      footsteps over the place where the breast of the phantom had been lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov walked on and after a little time whispered his wonder to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly as if alive! Seemed to breathe! And right in my way too! I have
      had an extraordinary experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a few steps and muttered through his set teeth&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall give him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then for some twenty yards or more all was blank. He wrapped his cloak
      closer round him. He pulled his cap well forward over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betray. A great word. What is betrayal? They talk of a man betraying his
      country, his friends, his sweetheart. There must be a moral bond first.
      All a man can betray is his conscience. And how is my conscience engaged
      here; by what bond of common faith, of common conviction, am I obliged to
      let that fanatical idiot drag me down with him? On the contrary&mdash;every
      obligation of true courage is the other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked round from under his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can the prejudice of the world reproach me with? Have I provoked his
      confidence? No! Have I by a single word, look, or gesture given him reason
      to suppose that I accepted his trust in me? No! It is true that I
      consented to go and see his Ziemianitch. Well, I have been to see him. And
      I broke a stick on his back too&mdash;the brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something seemed to turn over in his head bringing uppermost a singularly
      hard, clear facet of his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better, however,&rdquo; he reflected with a quite different mental
      accent, &ldquo;to keep that circumstance altogether to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had passed beyond the turn leading to his lodgings, and had reached a
      wide and fashionable street. Some shops were still open, and all the
      restaurants. Lights fell on the pavement where men in expensive fur coats,
      with here and there the elegant figure of a woman, walked with an air of
      leisure. Razumov looked at them with the contempt of an austere believer
      for the frivolous crowd. It was the world&mdash;those officers,
      dignitaries, men of fashion, officials, members of the Yacht Club. The
      event of the morning affected them all. What would they say if they knew
      what this student in a cloak was going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one of them is capable of feeling and thinking as deeply as I can.
      How many of them could accomplish an act of conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov lingered in the well-lighted street. He was firmly decided.
      Indeed, it could hardly be called a decision. He had simply discovered
      what he had meant to do all along. And yet he felt the need of some other
      mind&rsquo;s sanction.
    </p>
    <p>
      With something resembling anguish he said to himself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be understood.&rdquo; The universal aspiration with all its profound
      and melancholy meaning assailed heavily Razumov, who, amongst eighty
      millions of his kith and kin, had no heart to which he could open himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attorney was not to be thought of. He despised the little agent of
      chicane too much. One could not go and lay one&rsquo;s conscience before the
      policeman at the corner. Neither was Razumov anxious to go to the chief of
      his district&rsquo;s police&mdash;a common-looking person whom he used to see
      sometimes in the street in a shabby uniform and with a smouldering
      cigarette stuck to his lower lip. &ldquo;He would begin by locking me up most
      probably. At any rate, he is certain to get excited and create an awful
      commotion,&rdquo; thought Razumov practically.
    </p>
    <p>
      An act of conscience must be done with outward dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov longed desperately for a word of advice, for moral support. Who
      knows what true loneliness is&mdash;not the conventional word, but the
      naked terror? To the lonely themselves it wears a mask. The most miserable
      outcast hugs some memory or some illusion. Now and then a fatal
      conjunction of events may lift the veil for an instant. For an instant
      only. No human being could bear a steady view of moral solitude without
      going mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had reached that point of vision. To escape from it he embraced
      for a whole minute the delirious purpose of rushing to his lodgings and
      flinging himself on his knees by the side of the bed with the dark figure
      stretched on it; to pour out a full confession in passionate words that
      would stir the whole being of that man to its innermost depths; that would
      end in embraces and tears; in an incredible fellowship of souls&mdash;such
      as the world had never seen. It was sublime!
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly he wept and trembled already. But to the casual eyes that were
      cast upon him he was aware that he appeared as a tranquil student in a
      cloak, out for a leisurely stroll. He noted, too, the sidelong, brilliant
      glance of a pretty woman&mdash;with a delicate head, and covered in the
      hairy skins of wild beasts down to her feet, like a frail and beautiful
      savage&mdash;which rested for a moment with a sort of mocking tenderness
      on the deep abstraction of that good-looking young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Razumov stood still. The glimpse of a passing grey whisker,
      caught and lost in the same instant, had evoked the complete image of
      Prince K&mdash;-, the man who once had pressed his hand as no other man
      had pressed it&mdash;a faint but lingering pressure like a secret sign,
      like a half-unwilling caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Razumov marvelled at himself. Why did he not think of him before!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A senator, a dignitary, a great personage, the very man&mdash;He!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange softening emotion came over Razumov&mdash;made his knees shake a
      little. He repressed it with a new-born austerity. All that sentiment was
      pernicious nonsense. He couldn&rsquo;t be quick enough; and when he got into a
      sledge he shouted to the driver&mdash;&ldquo;to the K&mdash;- Palace. Get on&mdash;you!
      Fly!&rdquo; The startled moujik, bearded up to the very whites of his eyes,
      answered obsequiously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear, your high Nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was lucky for Razumov that Prince K&mdash;- was not a man of timid
      character. On the day of Mr. de P&mdash;-&rsquo;s murder an extreme alarm and
      despondency prevailed in the high official spheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince K&mdash;-, sitting sadly alone in his study, was told by his
      alarmed servants that a mysterious young man had forced his way into the
      hall, refused to tell his name and the nature of his business, and would
      not move from there till he had seen his Excellency in private. Instead of
      locking himself up and telephoning for the police, as nine out of ten high
      personages would have done that evening, the Prince gave way to curiosity
      and came quietly to the door of his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall, the front door standing wide open, he recognised at once
      Razumov, pale as death, his eyes blazing, and surrounded by perplexed
      lackeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was vexed beyond measure, and even indignant. But his humane
      instincts and a subtle sense of self-respect could not allow him to let
      this young man be thrown out into the street by base menials. He retreated
      unseen into his room, and after a little rang his bell. Razumov heard in
      the hall an ominously raised harsh voice saying somewhere far away&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show the gentleman in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov walked in without a tremor. He felt himself invulnerable&mdash;raised
      far above the shallowness of common judgment. Though he saw the Prince
      looking at him with black displeasure, the lucidity of his mind, of which
      he was very conscious, gave him an extraordinary assurance. He was not
      asked to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later they appeared in the hall together. The lackeys stood
      up, and the Prince, moving with difficulty on his gouty feet, was helped
      into his furs. The carriage had been ordered before. When the great double
      door was flung open with a crash, Razumov, who had been standing silent
      with a lost gaze but with every faculty intensely on the alert, heard the
      Prince&rsquo;s voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your arm, young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mobile, superficial mind of the ex-Guards officer, man of showy
      missions, experienced in nothing but the arts of gallant intrigue and
      worldly success, had been equally impressed by the more obvious
      difficulties of such a situation and by Razumov&rsquo;s quiet dignity in stating
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had said, &ldquo;No. Upon the whole I can&rsquo;t condemn the step you ventured to
      take by coming to me with your story. It is not an affair for police
      understrappers. The greatest importance is attached to.... Set your mind
      at rest. I shall see you through this most extraordinary and difficult
      situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Prince rose to ring the bell, and Razumov, making a short bow,
      had said with deference&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have trusted my instinct. A young man having no claim upon anybody in
      the world has in an hour of trial involving his deepest political
      convictions turned to an illustrious Russian&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince had exclaimed hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the carriage&mdash;it was a small brougham on sleigh runners&mdash;Razumov
      broke the silence in a voice that trembled slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gratitude surpasses the greatness of my presumption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gasped, feeling unexpectedly in the dark a momentary pressure on his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; repeated the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the carriage stopped the Prince murmured to Razumov, who had never
      ventured a single question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house of General T&mdash;-.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the snow-covered roadway blazed a great bonfire. Some
      Cossacks, the bridles of their horses over the arm, were warming
      themselves around. Two sentries stood at the door, several gendarmes
      lounged under the great carriage gateway, and on the first-floor landing
      two orderlies rose and stood at attention. Razumov walked at the Prince&rsquo;s
      elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A surprising quantity of hot-house plants in pots cumbered the floor of
      the ante-room. Servants came forward. A young man in civilian clothes
      arrived hurriedly, was whispered to, bowed low, and exclaiming zealously,
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;this minute,&rdquo; fled within somewhere. The Prince signed to
      Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed through a suite of reception-rooms all barely lit and one of
      them prepared for dancing. The wife of the General had put off her party.
      An atmosphere of consternation pervaded the place. But the General&rsquo;s own
      room, with heavy sombre hangings, two massive desks, and deep armchairs,
      had all the lights turned on. The footman shut the door behind them and
      they waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a coal fire in an English grate; Razumov had never before seen
      such a fire; and the silence of the room was like the silence of the
      grave; perfect, measureless, for even the clock on the mantelpiece made no
      sound. Filling a corner, on a black pedestal, stood a quarter-life-size
      smooth-limbed bronze of an adolescent figure, running. The Prince observed
      in an undertone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spontini&rsquo;s. &lsquo;Flight of Youth.&rsquo; Exquisite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable,&rdquo; assented Razumov faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said nothing more after this, the Prince silent with his grand air,
      Razumov staring at the statue. He was worried by a sensation resembling
      the gnawing of hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not turn when he heard an inner door fly open, and a quick
      footstep, muffled on the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince&rsquo;s voice immediately exclaimed, thick with excitement&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got him&mdash;<i>ce miserable</i>. A worthy young man came to me&mdash;No!
      It&rsquo;s incredible....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov held his breath before the bronze as if expecting a crash. Behind
      his back a voice he had never heard before insisted politely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Asseyez-vous donc</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince almost shrieked, &ldquo;<i>Mais comprenez-vous, mon cher! L&rsquo;assassin</i>!
      the murderer&mdash;we have got him....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov spun round. The General&rsquo;s smooth big cheeks rested on the stiff
      collar of his uniform. He must have been already looking at Razumov,
      because that last saw the pale blue eyes fastened on him coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince from a chair waved an impressive hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a most honourable young man whom Providence itself... Mr.
      Razumov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General acknowledged the introduction by frowning at Razumov, who did
      not make the slightest movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting down before his desk the General listened with compressed lips. It
      was impossible to detect any sign of emotion on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov watched the immobility of the fleshy profile. But it lasted only a
      moment, till the Prince had finished; and when the General turned to the
      providential young man, his florid complexion, the blue, unbelieving eyes
      and the bright white flash of an automatic smile had an air of jovial,
      careless cruelty. He expressed no wonder at the extraordinary story&mdash;no
      pleasure or excitement&mdash;no incredulity either. He betrayed no
      sentiment whatever. Only with a politeness almost deferential suggested
      that &ldquo;the bird might have flown while Mr.&mdash;Mr. Razumov was running
      about the streets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov advanced to the middle of the room and said, &ldquo;The door is locked
      and I have the key in my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His loathing for the man was intense. It had come upon him so unawares
      that he felt he had not kept it out of his voice. The General looked up at
      him thoughtfully, and Razumov grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this went over the head of Prince K&mdash;- seated in a deep armchair,
      very tired and impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A student called Haldin,&rdquo; said the General thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov ceased to grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is his name,&rdquo; he said unnecessarily loud. &ldquo;Victor Victorovitch
      Haldin&mdash;a student.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General shifted his position a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he dressed? Would you have the goodness to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov angrily described Haldin&rsquo;s clothing in a few jerky words. The
      General stared all the time, then addressing the Prince&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not without some indications,&rdquo; he said in French. &ldquo;A good woman
      who was in the street described to us somebody wearing a dress of the sort
      as the thrower of the second bomb. We have detained her at the
      Secretariat, and every one in a Tcherkess coat we could lay our hands on
      has been brought to her to look at. She kept on crossing herself and
      shaking her head at them. It was exasperating....&rdquo; He turned to Razumov,
      and in Russian, with friendly reproach&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a chair, Mr. Razumov&mdash;do. Why are you standing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov sat down carelessly and looked at the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This goggle-eyed imbecile understands nothing,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince began to speak loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Razumov is a young man of conspicuous abilities. I have it at heart
      that his future should not....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; interrupted the General, with a movement of the hand. &ldquo;Has he
      any weapons on him, do you think, Mr. Razumov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General employed a gentle musical voice. Razumov answered with
      suppressed irritation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But my razors are lying about&mdash;you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General lowered his head approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then to the Prince, explaining courteously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want that bird alive. It will be the devil if we can&rsquo;t make him sing a
      little before we are done with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grave-like silence of the room with its mute clock fell upon the
      polite modulations of this terrible phrase. The Prince, hidden in the
      chair, made no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General unexpectedly developed a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fidelity to menaced institutions on which depend the safety of a throne
      and of a people is no child&rsquo;s play. We know that, <i>mon Prince,</i> and&mdash;<i>tenez</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
       he went on with a sort of flattering harshness, &ldquo;Mr. Razumov here begins
      to understand that too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes which he turned upon Razumov seemed to be starting out of his
      head. This grotesqueness of aspect no longer shocked Razumov. He said with
      gloomy conviction&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haldin will never speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; muttered the General.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain,&rdquo; insisted Razumov. &ldquo;A man like this never speaks.... Do you
      imagine that I am here from fear?&rdquo; he added violently. He felt ready to
      stand by his opinion of Haldin to the last extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; protested the General, with great simplicity of tone.
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, Mr. Razumov, that if he had not come with
      his tale to such a staunch and loyal Russian as you, he would have
      disappeared like a stone in the water... which would have had a detestable
      effect,&rdquo; he added, with a bright, cruel smile under his stony stare. &ldquo;So
      you see, there can be no suspicion of any fear here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince intervened, looking at Razumov round the back of the armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody doubts the moral soundness of your action. Be at ease in that
      respect, pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the General uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I am here. You may be surprised why I should....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General hastened to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Extremely natural. You saw the importance....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; broke in the Prince. &ldquo;And I venture to ask insistently that mine
      and Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s intervention should not become public. He is a young man
      of promise&mdash;of remarkable aptitudes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it,&rdquo; murmured the General. &ldquo;He inspires confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All sorts of pernicious views are so widespread nowadays&mdash;they taint
      such unexpected quarters&mdash;that, monstrous as it seems, he might
      suffer ...his studies...his...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General, with his elbows on the desk, took his head between his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Yes. I am thinking it out.... How long is it since you left him at
      your rooms, Mr. Razumov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov mentioned the hour which nearly corresponded with the time of his
      distracted flight from the big slum house. He had made up his mind to keep
      Ziemianitch out of the affair completely. To mention him at all would mean
      imprisonment for the &ldquo;bright soul,&rdquo; perhaps cruel floggings, and in the
      end a journey to Siberia in chains. Razumov, who had beaten Ziemianitch,
      felt for him now a vague, remorseful tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General, giving way for the first time to his secret sentiments,
      exclaimed contemptuously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you say he came in to make you this confidence like this&mdash;for
      nothing&mdash;<i>a propos des bottes</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov felt danger in the air. The merciless suspicion of despotism had
      spoken openly at last. Sudden fear sealed Razumov&rsquo;s lips. The silence of
      the room resembled now the silence of a deep dungeon, where time does not
      count, and a suspect person is sometimes forgotten for ever. But the
      Prince came to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providence itself has led the wretch in a moment of mental aberration to
      seek Mr. Razumov on the strength of some old, utterly misinterpreted
      exchange of ideas&mdash;some sort of idle speculative conversation&mdash;months
      ago&mdash;I am told&mdash;and completely forgotten till now by Mr.
      Razumov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Razumov,&rdquo; queried the General meditatively, after a short silence,
      &ldquo;do you often indulge in speculative conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Excellency,&rdquo; answered Razumov, coolly, in a sudden access of
      self-confidence. &ldquo;I am a man of deep convictions. Crude opinions are in
      the air. They are not always worth combating. But even the silent contempt
      of a serious mind may be misinterpreted by headlong utopists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General stared from between his hands. Prince K&mdash;- murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A serious young man. <i>Un esprit superieur</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that, <i>mon cher Prince</i>,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;Mr. Razumov is
      quite safe with me. I am interested in him. He has, it seems, the great
      and useful quality of inspiring confidence. What I was wondering at is why
      the other should mention anything at all&mdash;I mean even the bare fact
      alone&mdash;if his object was only to obtain temporary shelter for a few
      hours. For, after all, nothing was easier than to say nothing about it
      unless, indeed, he were trying, under a crazy misapprehension of your true
      sentiments, to enlist your assistance&mdash;eh, Mr. Razumov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Razumov that the floor was moving slightly. This grotesque
      man in a tight uniform was terrible. It was right that he should be
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see what your Excellency has in your mind. But I can only answer
      that I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing in my mind,&rdquo; murmured the General, with gentle surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his prey&mdash;his helpless prey,&rdquo; thought Razumov. The fatigues and
      the disgusts of that afternoon, the need to forget, the fear which he
      could not keep off, reawakened his hate for Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t help your Excellency. I don&rsquo;t know what he meant. I only
      know there was a moment when I wished to kill him. There was also a moment
      when I wished myself dead. I said nothing. I was overcome. I provoked no
      confidence&mdash;I asked for no explanations&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov seemed beside himself; but his mind was lucid. It was really a
      calculated outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is rather a pity,&rdquo; the General said, &ldquo;that you did not. Don&rsquo;t you know
      at all what he means to do?&rdquo; Razumov calmed down and saw an opening there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me he was in hopes that a sledge would meet him about half an
      hour after midnight at the seventh lamp-post on the left from the upper
      end of Karabelnaya. At any rate, he meant to be there at that time. He did
      not even ask me for a change of clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah voila</i>!&rdquo; said the General, turning to Prince K with an air of
      satisfaction. &ldquo;There is a way to keep your <i>protege</i>, Mr. Razumov,
      quite clear of any connexion with the actual arrest. We shall be ready for
      that gentleman in Karabelnaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince expressed his gratitude. There was real emotion in his voice.
      Razumov, motionless, silent, sat staring at the carpet. The General turned
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour after midnight. Till then we have to depend on you, Mr.
      Razumov. You don&rsquo;t think he is likely to change his purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; said Razumov. &ldquo;Those men are not of the sort that ever
      changes its purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What men do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanatical lovers of liberty in general. Liberty with a capital L,
      Excellency. Liberty that means nothing precise. Liberty in whose name
      crimes are committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I detest rebels of every kind. I can&rsquo;t help it. It&rsquo;s my nature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clenched a fist and shook it, drawing back his arm. &ldquo;They shall be
      destroyed, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have made a sacrifice of their lives beforehand,&rdquo; said Razumov with
      malicious pleasure and looking the General straight in the face. &ldquo;If
      Haldin does change his purpose to-night, you may depend on it that it will
      not be to save his life by flight in some other way. He would have thought
      then of something else to attempt. But that is not likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General repeated as if to himself, &ldquo;They shall be destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov assumed an impenetrable expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a terrible necessity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General&rsquo;s arm was lowered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One comfort there is. That brood leaves no posterity. I&rsquo;ve always said
      it, one effort, pitiless, persistent, steady&mdash;and we are done with
      them for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov thought to himself that this man entrusted with so much arbitrary
      power must have believed what he said or else he could not have gone on
      bearing the responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I detest rebels. These subversive minds! These intellectual <i>debauches</i>!
      My existence has been built on fidelity. It&rsquo;s a feeling. To defend it I am
      ready to lay down my life&mdash;and even my honour&mdash;if that were
      needed. But pray tell me what honour can there be as against rebels&mdash;against
      people that deny God Himself&mdash;perfect unbelievers! Brutes. It is
      horrible to think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this tirade Razumov, facing the General, had nodded slightly twice.
      Prince K&mdash;-, standing on one side with his grand air, murmured,
      casting up his eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Helas!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then lowering his glance and with great decision declared&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young man, General, is perfectly fit to apprehend the bearing of
      your memorable words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General&rsquo;s whole expression changed from dull resentment to perfect
      urbanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask now, Mr. Razumov,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to return to his home. Note that
      I don&rsquo;t ask Mr. Razumov whether he has justified his absence to his guest.
      No doubt he did this sufficiently. But I don&rsquo;t ask. Mr. Razumov inspires
      confidence. It is a great gift. I only suggest that a more prolonged
      absence might awaken the criminal&rsquo;s suspicions and induce him perhaps to
      change his plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and with a scrupulous courtesy escorted his visitors to the
      ante-room encumbered with flower-pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov parted with the Prince at the corner of a street. In the carriage
      he had listened to speeches where natural sentiment struggled with
      caution. Evidently the Prince was afraid of encouraging any hopes of
      future intercourse. But there was a touch of tenderness in the voice
      uttering in the dark the guarded general phrases of goodwill. And the
      Prince too said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have perfect confidence in you, Mr. Razumov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all, it seems, have confidence in me,&rdquo; thought Razumov dully. He had
      an indulgent contempt for the man sitting shoulder to shoulder with him in
      the confined space. Probably he was afraid of scenes with his wife. She
      was said to be proud and violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him bizarre that secrecy should play such a large part in the
      comfort and safety of lives. But he wanted to put the Prince&rsquo;s mind at
      ease; and with a proper amount of emphasis he said that, being conscious
      of some small abilities and confident in his power of work, he trusted his
      future to his own exertions. He expressed his gratitude for the helping
      hand. Such dangerous situations did not occur twice in the course of one
      life&mdash;he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have met this one with a firmness of mind and correctness of
      feeling which give me a high idea of your worth,&rdquo; the Prince said
      solemnly. &ldquo;You have now only to persevere&mdash;to persevere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On getting out on the pavement Razumov saw an ungloved hand extended to
      him through the lowered window of the brougham. It detained his own in its
      grasp for a moment, while the light of a street lamp fell upon the
      Prince&rsquo;s long face and old-fashioned grey whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are perfectly reassured now as to the consequences...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After what your Excellency has condescended to do for me, I can only rely
      on my conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Adieu</i>,&rdquo; said the whiskered head with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov bowed. The brougham glided away with a slight swish in the snow&mdash;he
      was alone on the edge of the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to himself that there was nothing to think about, and began
      walking towards his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked quietly. It was a common experience to walk thus home to bed
      after an evening spent somewhere with his fellows or in the cheaper seats
      of a theatre. After he had gone a little way the familiarity of things got
      hold of him. Nothing was changed. There was the familiar corner; and when
      he turned it he saw the familiar dim light of the provision shop kept by a
      German woman. There were loaves of stale bread, bunches of onions and
      strings of sausages behind the small window-panes. They were closing it.
      The sickly lame fellow whom he knew so well by sight staggered out into
      the snow embracing a large shutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would change. There was the familiar gateway yawning black with
      feeble glimmers marking the arches of the different staircases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of life&rsquo;s continuity depended on trifling bodily impressions.
      The trivialities of daily existence were an armour for the soul. And this
      thought reinforced the inward quietness of Razumov as he began to climb
      the stairs familiar to his feet in the dark, with his hand on the familiar
      clammy banister. The exceptional could not prevail against the material
      contacts which make one day resemble another. To-morrow would be like
      yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only on the stage that the unusual was outwardly acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; thought Razumov, &ldquo;that if I had made up my mind to blow out
      my brains on the landing I would be going up these stairs as quietly as I
      am doing it now. What&rsquo;s a man to do? What must be must be. Extraordinary
      things do happen. But when they have happened they are done with. Thus,
      too, when the mind is made up. That question is done with. And the daily
      concerns, the familiarities of our thought swallow it up&mdash;and the
      life goes on as before with its mysterious and secret sides quite out of
      sight, as they should be. Life is a public thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov unlocked his door and took the key out; entered very quietly and
      bolted the door behind him carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, &ldquo;He hears me,&rdquo; and after bolting the door he stood still
      holding his breath. There was not a sound. He crossed the bare outer room,
      stepping deliberately in the darkness. Entering the other, he felt all
      over his table for the matchbox. The silence, but for the groping of his
      hand, was profound. Could the fellow be sleeping so soundly?
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck a light and looked at the bed. Haldin was lying on his back as
      before, only both his hands were under his head. His eyes were open. He
      stared at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov held the match up. He saw the clear-cut features, the firm chin,
      the white forehead and the topknot of fair hair against the white pillow.
      There he was, lying flat on his back. Razumov thought suddenly, &ldquo;I have
      walked over his chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to stare till the match burnt itself out; then struck another
      and lit the lamp in silence without looking towards the bed any more. He
      had turned his back on it and was hanging his coat on a peg when he heard
      Haldin sigh profoundly, then ask in a tired voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! And what have you arranged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The emotion was so great that Razumov was glad to put his hands against
      the wall. A diabolical impulse to say, &ldquo;I have given you up to the
      police,&rdquo; frightened him exceedingly. But he did not say that. He said,
      without turning round, in a muffled voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he heard Haldin sigh. He walked to the table, sat down with the lamp
      before him, and only then looked towards the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the distant corner of the large room far away from the lamp, which was
      small and provided with a very thick china shade, Haldin appeared like a
      dark and elongated shape&mdash;rigid with the immobility of death. This
      body seemed to have less substance than its own phantom walked over by
      Razumov in the street white with snow. It was more alarming in its
      shadowy, persistent reality than the distinct but vanishing illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldin was heard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have had a walk&mdash;such a walk,...&rdquo; he murmured
      deprecatingly. &ldquo;This weather....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov answered with energy&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible walk.... A nightmare of a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered audibly. Haldin sighed once more, then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you have seen Ziemianitch&mdash;brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, remembering the time he had spent with the Prince, thought it
      prudent to add, &ldquo;I had to wait some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A character&mdash;eh? It&rsquo;s extraordinary what a sense of the necessity of
      freedom there is in that man. And he has sayings too&mdash;simple, to the
      point, such as only the people can invent in their rough sagacity. A
      character that....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, you understand, haven&rsquo;t had much opportunity....&rdquo; Razumov muttered
      through his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldin continued to stare at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, brother, I have been a good deal in that house of late. I used
      to take there books&mdash;leaflets. Not a few of the poor people who live
      there can read. And, you see, the guests for the feast of freedom must be
      sought for in byways and hedges. The truth is, I have almost lived in that
      house of late. I slept sometimes in the stable. There is a stable....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I had my interview with Ziemianitch,&rdquo; interrupted Razumov
      gently. A mocking spirit entered into him and he added, &ldquo;It was
      satisfactory in a sense. I came away from it much relieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s a fellow,&rdquo; went on Haldin, talking slowly at the ceiling. &ldquo;I
      came to know him in that way, you see. For some weeks now, ever since I
      resigned myself to do what had to be done, I tried to isolate myself. I
      gave up my rooms. What was the good of exposing a decent widow woman to
      the risk of being worried out of her mind by the police? I gave up seeing
      any of our comrades....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov drew to himself a half-sheet of paper and began to trace lines on
      it with a pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he thought angrily, &ldquo;he seems to have thought of
      everybody&rsquo;s safety but mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haldin was talking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning&mdash;ah! this morning&mdash;that was different. How can I
      explain to you? Before the deed was done I wandered at night and lay hid
      in the day, thinking it out, and I felt restful. Sleepless but restful.
      What was there for me to torment myself about? But this morning&mdash;after!
      Then it was that I became restless. I could not have stopped in that big
      house full of misery. The miserable of this world can&rsquo;t give you peace.
      Then when that silly caretaker began to shout, I said to myself, &lsquo;There is
      a young man in this town head and shoulders above common prejudices.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he laughing at me?&rdquo; Razumov asked himself, going on with his aimless
      drawing of triangles and squares. And suddenly he thought: &ldquo;My behaviour
      must appear to him strange. Should he take fright at my manner and rush
      off somewhere I shall be undone completely. That infernal General....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the pencil and turned abruptly towards the bed with the shadowy
      figure extended full length on it&mdash;so much more indistinct than the
      one over whose breast he had walked without faltering. Was this, too, a
      phantom?
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence had lasted a long time. &ldquo;He is no longer here,&rdquo; was the
      thought against which Razumov struggled desperately, quite frightened at
      its absurdity. &ldquo;He is already gone and this...only...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could resist no longer. He sprang to his feet, saying aloud, &ldquo;I am
      intolerably anxious,&rdquo; and in a few headlong strides stood by the side of
      the bed. His hand fell lightly on Haldin&rsquo;s shoulder, and directly he felt
      its reality he was beset by an insane temptation to grip that exposed
      throat and squeeze the breath out of that body, lest it should escape his
      custody, leaving only a phantom behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldin did not stir a limb, but his overshadowed eyes moving a little
      gazed upwards at Razumov with wistful gratitude for this manifestation of
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov turned away and strode up and down the room. &ldquo;It would have been
      possibly a kindness,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, and was appalled by the
      nature of that apology for a murderous intention his mind had found
      somewhere within him. And all the same he could not give it up. He became
      lucid about it. &ldquo;What can he expect?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;The halter&mdash;in the
      end. And I....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This argument was interrupted by Haldin&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why be anxious for me? They can kill my body, but they cannot exile my
      soul from this world. I tell you what&mdash;I believe in this world so
      much that I cannot conceive eternity otherwise than as a very long life.
      That is perhaps the reason I am so ready to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; muttered Razumov, and biting his lower lip he continued to walk up
      and down and to carry on his strange argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, to a man in such a situation&mdash;of course it would be an act of
      kindness. The question, however, was not how to be kind, but how to be
      firm. He was a slippery customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I too, Victor Victorovitch, believe in this world of ours,&rdquo; he said with
      force. &ldquo;I too, while I live.... But you seem determined to haunt it. You
      can&rsquo;t seriously...mean...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the motionless Haldin began&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haunt it! Truly, the oppressors of thought which quickens the world, the
      destroyers of souls which aspire to perfection of human dignity, they
      shall be haunted. As to the destroyers of my mere body, I have forgiven
      them beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had stopped apparently to listen, but at the same time he was
      observing his own sensations. He was vexed with himself for attaching so
      much importance to what Haldin said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; he thought firmly, but this opinion did not mollify
      him towards Haldin. It was a particularly impudent form of lunacy&mdash;and
      when it got loose in the sphere of public life of a country, it was
      obviously the duty of every good citizen....
    </p>
    <p>
      This train of thought broke off short there and was succeeded by a
      paroxysm of silent hatred towards Haldin, so intense that Razumov hastened
      to speak at random.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Eternity, of course. I, too, can&rsquo;t very well represent it to
      myself.... I imagine it, however, as something quiet and dull. There would
      be nothing unexpected&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see? The element of time would be
      wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled out his watch and gazed at it. Haldin turned over on his side
      and looked on intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov got frightened at this movement. A slippery customer this fellow
      with a phantom. It was not midnight yet. He hastened on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And unfathomable mysteries! Can you conceive secret places in Eternity?
      Impossible. Whereas life is full of them. There are secrets of birth, for
      instance. One carries them on to the grave. There is something
      comical...but never mind. And there are secret motives of conduct. A man&rsquo;s
      most open actions have a secret side to them. That is interesting and so
      unfathomable! For instance, a man goes out of a room for a walk. Nothing
      more trivial in appearance. And yet it may be momentous. He comes back&mdash;he
      has seen perhaps a drunken brute, taken particular notice of the snow on
      the ground&mdash;and behold he is no longer the same man. The most
      unlikely things have a secret power over one&rsquo;s thoughts&mdash;the grey
      whiskers of a particular person&mdash;the goggle eyes of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov&rsquo;s forehead was moist. He took a turn or two in the room, his head
      low and smiling to himself viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever reflected on the power of goggle eyes and grey whiskers?
      Excuse me. You seem to think I must be crazy to talk in this vein at such
      a time. But I am not talking lightly. I have seen instances. It has
      happened to me once to be talking to a man whose fate was affected by
      physical facts of that kind. And the man did not know it. Of course, it
      was a case of conscience, but the material facts such as these brought
      about the solution.... And you tell me, Victor Victorovitch, not to be
      anxious! Why! I am responsible for you,&rdquo; Razumov almost shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He avoided with difficulty a burst of Mephistophelian laughter. Haldin,
      very pale, raised himself on his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the surprises of life,&rdquo; went on Razumov, after glancing at the other
      uneasily. &ldquo;Just consider their astonishing nature. A mysterious impulse
      induces you to come here. I don&rsquo;t say you have done wrong. Indeed, from a
      certain point of view you could not have done better. You might have gone
      to a man with affections and family ties. You have such ties yourself. As
      to me, you know I have been brought up in an educational institute where
      they did not give us enough to eat. To talk of affection in such a
      connexion&mdash;you perceive yourself.... As to ties, the only ties I have
      in the world are social. I must get acknowledged in some way before I can
      act at all. I sit here working.... And don&rsquo;t you think I am working for
      progress too? I&rsquo;ve got to find my own ideas of the true way.... Pardon
      me,&rdquo; continued Razumov, after drawing breath and with a short, throaty
      laugh, &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t inherited a revolutionary inspiration together with
      a resemblance from an uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked again at his watch and noticed with sickening disgust that there
      were yet a good many minutes to midnight. He tore watch and chain off his
      waistcoat and laid them on the table well in the circle of bright
      lamplight. Haldin, reclining on his elbow, did not stir. Razumov was made
      uneasy by this attitude. &ldquo;What move is he meditating over so quietly?&rdquo; he
      thought. &ldquo;He must be prevented. I must keep on talking to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a son, a brother, a nephew, a cousin&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;to
      no end of people. I am just a man. Here I stand before you. A man with a
      mind. Did it ever occur to you how a man who had never heard a word of
      warm affection or praise in his life would think on matters on which you
      would think first with or against your class, your domestic tradition&mdash;your
      fireside prejudices?... Did you ever consider how a man like that would
      feel? I have no domestic tradition. I have nothing to think against. My
      tradition is historical. What have I to look back to but that national
      past from which you gentlemen want to wrench away your future? Am I to let
      my intelligence, my aspirations towards a better lot, be robbed of the
      only thing it has to go upon at the will of violent enthusiasts? You come
      from your province, but all this land is mine&mdash;or I have nothing. No
      doubt you shall be looked upon as a martyr some day&mdash;a sort of hero&mdash;a
      political saint. But I beg to be excused. I am content in fitting myself
      to be a worker. And what can you people do by scattering a few drops of
      blood on the snow? On this Immensity. On this unhappy Immensity! I tell
      you,&rdquo; he cried, in a vibrating, subdued voice, and advancing one step
      nearer the bed, &ldquo;that what it needs is not a lot of haunting phantoms that
      I could walk through&mdash;but a man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haldin threw his arms forward as if to keep him off in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand it all now,&rdquo; he exclaimed, with awestruck dismay. &ldquo;I
      understand&mdash;at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov staggered back against the table. His forehead broke out in
      perspiration while a cold shudder ran down his spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I been saying?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Have I let him slip through
      my fingers after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He felt his lips go stiff like buckram, and instead of a reassuring smile
      only achieved an uncertain grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo; he began in a conciliating voice which got steady
      after the first trembling word or two. &ldquo;What will you have? Consider&mdash;a
      man of studious, retired habits&mdash;and suddenly like this.... I am not
      practised in talking delicately. But...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt anger, a wicked anger, get hold of him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were we to do together till midnight? Sit here opposite each other
      and think of your&mdash;your&mdash;shambles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haldin had a subdued, heartbroken attitude. He bowed his head; his hands
      hung between his knees. His voice was low and pained but calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see now how it is, Razumov&mdash;brother. You are a magnanimous soul,
      but my action is abhorrent to you&mdash;alas....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov stared. From fright he had set his teeth so hard that his whole
      face ached. It was impossible for him to make a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even my person, too, is loathsome to you perhaps,&rdquo; Haldin added
      mournfully, after a short pause, looking up for a moment, then fixing his
      gaze on the floor. &ldquo;For indeed, unless one....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off evidently waiting for a word. Razumov remained silent. Haldin
      nodded his head dejectedly twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Of course,&rdquo; he murmured.... &ldquo;Ah! weary work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained perfectly still for a moment, then made Razumov&rsquo;s leaden heart
      strike a ponderous blow by springing up briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; he cried sadly in a low, distinct tone. &ldquo;Farewell then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov started forward, but the sight of Haldin&rsquo;s raised hand checked him
      before he could get away from the table. He leaned on it heavily,
      listening to the faint sounds of some town clock tolling the hour. Haldin,
      already at the door, tall and straight as an arrow, with his pale face and
      a hand raised attentively, might have posed for the statue of a daring
      youth listening to an inner voice. Razumov mechanically glanced down at
      his watch. When he looked towards the door again Haldin had vanished.
      There was a faint rustling in the outer room, the feeble click of a bolt
      drawn back lightly. He was gone&mdash;almost as noiseless as a vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov ran forward unsteadily, with parted, voiceless lips. The outer
      door stood open. Staggering out on the landing, he leaned far over the
      banister. Gazing down into the deep black shaft with a tiny glimmering
      flame at the bottom, he traced by ear the rapid spiral descent of somebody
      running down the stairs on tiptoe. It was a light, swift, pattering sound,
      which sank away from him into the depths: a fleeting shadow passed over
      the glimmer&mdash;a wink of the tiny flame. Then stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov hung over, breathing the cold raw air tainted by the evil smells
      of the unclean staircase. All quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back into his room slowly, shutting the doors after him. The
      peaceful steady light of his reading-lamp shone on the watch. Razumov
      stood looking down at the little white dial. It wanted yet three minutes
      to midnight. He took the watch into his hand fumblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slow,&rdquo; he muttered, and a strange fit of nervelessness came over him. His
      knees shook, the watch and chain slipped through his fingers in an instant
      and fell on the floor. He was so startled that he nearly fell himself.
      When at last he regained enough confidence in his limbs to stoop for it he
      held it to his ear at once. After a while he growled&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stopped,&rdquo; and paused for quite a long time before he muttered sourly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done.... And now to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, reached haphazard for a book, opened it in middle and began
      to read; but after going conscientiously over two lines he lost his hold
      on the print completely and did not try to regain it. He thought&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was to a certainty a police agent of some sort watching the house
      across the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He imagined him lurking in a dark gateway, goggle-eyed, muffled up in a
      cloak to the nose and with a General&rsquo;s plumed, cocked hat on his head.
      This absurdity made him start in the chair convulsively. He literally had
      to shake his head violently to get rid of it. The man would be disguised
      perhaps as a peasant... a beggar.... Perhaps he would be just buttoned up
      in a dark overcoat and carrying a loaded stick&mdash;a shifty-eyed rascal,
      smelling of raw onions and spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This evocation brought on positive nausea. &ldquo;Why do I want to bother about
      this?&rdquo; thought Razumov with disgust. &ldquo;Am I a gendarme? Moreover, it is
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up in great agitation. It was not done. Not yet. Not till half-past
      twelve. And the watch had stopped. This reduced him to despair. Impossible
      to know the time! The landlady and all the people across the landing were
      asleep. How could he go and... God knows what they would imagine, or how
      much they would guess. He dared not go into the streets to find out. &ldquo;I am
      a suspect now. There&rsquo;s no use shirking that fact,&rdquo; he said to himself
      bitterly. If Haldin from some cause or another gave them the slip and
      failed to turn up in the Karabelnaya the police would be invading his
      lodging. And if he were not in he could never clear himself. Never.
      Razumov looked wildly about as if for some means of seizing upon time
      which seemed to have escaped him altogether. He had never, as far as he
      could remember, heard the striking of that town clock in his rooms before
      this night. And he was not even sure now whether he had heard it really on
      this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the window and stood there with slightly bent head on the watch
      for the faint sound. &ldquo;I will stay here till I hear something,&rdquo; he said to
      himself. He stood still, his ear turned to the panes. An atrocious aching
      numbness with shooting pains in his back and legs tortured him. He did not
      budge. His mind hovered on the borders of delirium. He heard himself
      suddenly saying, &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; as a person might do on the rack. &ldquo;I am on
      the rack,&rdquo; he thought. He felt ready to swoon. The faint deep boom of the
      distant clock seemed to explode in his head&mdash;he heard it so
      clearly.... One!
    </p>
    <p>
      If Haldin had not turned up the police would have been already here
      ransacking the house. No sound reached him. This time it was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged himself painfully to the table and dropped into the chair. He
      flung the book away and took a square sheet of paper. It was like the pile
      of sheets covered with his neat minute handwriting, only blank. He took a
      pen brusquely and dipped it with a vague notion of going on with the
      writing of his essay&mdash;but his pen remained poised over the sheet. It
      hung there for some time before it came down and formed long scrawly
      letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still-faced and his lips set hard, Razumov began to write. When he wrote a
      large hand his neat writing lost its character altogether&mdash;became
      unsteady, almost childish. He wrote five lines one under the other.
      History not Theory. Patriotism not Internationalism. Evolution not
      Revolution. Direction not Destruction. Unity not Disruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at them dully. Then his eyes strayed to the bed and remained
      fixed there for a good many minutes, while his right hand groped all over
      the table for the penknife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose at last, and walking up with measured steps stabbed the paper with
      the penknife to the lath and plaster wall at the head of the bed. This
      done he stepped back a pace and flourished his hand with a glance round
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he never looked again at the bed. He took his big cloak down
      from its peg and, wrapping himself up closely, went to lie down on the
      hard horse-hair sofa at the other side of his room. A leaden sleep closed
      his eyelids at once. Several times that night he woke up shivering from a
      dream of walking through drifts of snow in a Russia where he was as
      completely alone as any betrayed autocrat could be; an immense, wintry
      Russia which, somehow, his view could embrace in all its enormous expanse
      as if it were a map. But after each shuddering start his heavy eyelids
      fell over his glazed eyes and he slept again.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching this part of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s story, my mind, the decent mind of
      an old teacher of languages, feels more and more the difficulty of the
      task.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task is not in truth the writing in the narrative form a <i>precis</i>
      of a strange human document, but the rendering&mdash;I perceive it now
      clearly&mdash;of the moral conditions ruling over a large portion of this
      earth&rsquo;s surface; conditions not easily to be understood, much less
      discovered in the limits of a story, till some key-word is found; a word
      that could stand at the back of all the words covering the pages; a word
      which, if not truth itself, may perchance hold truth enough to help the
      moral discovery which should be the object of every tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turn over for the hundredth time the leaves of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s record, I
      lay it aside, I take up the pen&mdash;and the pen being ready for its
      office of setting down black on white I hesitate. For the word that
      persists in creeping under its point is no other word than &ldquo;cynicism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For that is the mark of Russian autocracy and of Russian revolt. In its
      pride of numbers, in its strange pretensions of sanctity, and in the
      secret readiness to abase itself in suffering, the spirit of Russia is the
      spirit of cynicism. It informs the declarations of her statesmen, the
      theories of her revolutionists, and the mystic vaticinations of prophets
      to the point of making freedom look like a form of debauch, and the
      Christian virtues themselves appear actually indecent.... But I must
      apologize for the digression. It proceeds from the consideration of the
      course taken by the story of Mr. Razumov after his conservative
      convictions, diluted in a vague liberalism natural to the ardour of his
      age, had become crystallized by the shock of his contact with Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov woke up for the tenth time perhaps with a heavy shiver. Seeing the
      light of day in his window, he resisted the inclination to lay himself
      down again. He did not remember anything, but he did not think it strange
      to find himself on the sofa in his cloak and chilled to the bone. The
      light coming through the window seemed strangely cheerless, containing no
      promise as the light of each new day should for a young man. It was the
      awakening of a man mortally ill, or of a man ninety years old. He looked
      at the lamp which had burnt itself out. It stood there, the extinguished
      beacon of his labours, a cold object of brass and porcelain, amongst the
      scattered pages of his notes and small piles of books&mdash;a mere litter
      of blackened paper&mdash;dead matter&mdash;without significance or
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got on his feet, and divesting himself of his cloak hung it on the peg,
      going through all the motions mechanically. An incredible dullness, a
      ditch-water stagnation was sensible to his perceptions as though life had
      withdrawn itself from all things and even from his own thoughts. There was
      not a sound in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning away from the peg, he thought in that same lifeless manner that it
      must be very early yet; but when he looked at the watch on his table he
      saw both hands arrested at twelve o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself, and as if beginning to get roused a
      little he took a survey of his room. The paper stabbed to the wall
      arrested his attention. He eyed it from the distance without approval or
      perplexity; but when he heard the servant-girl beginning to bustle about
      in the outer room with the <i>samovar</i> for his morning tea, he walked
      up to it and took it down with an air of profound indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      While doing this he glanced down at the bed on which he had not slept that
      night. The hollow in the pillow made by the weight of Haldin&rsquo;s head was
      very noticeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even his anger at this sign of the man&rsquo;s passage was dull. He did not try
      to nurse it into life. He did nothing all that day; he neglected even to
      brush his hair. The idea of going out never occurred to him&mdash;and if
      he did not start a connected train of thought it was not because he was
      unable to think. It was because he was not interested enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He yawned frequently. He drank large quantities of tea, he walked about
      aimlessly, and when he sat down he did not budge for a long time. He spent
      some time drumming on the window with his finger-tips quietly. In his
      listless wanderings round about the table he caught sight of his own face
      in the looking-glass and that arrested him. The eyes which returned his
      stare were the most unhappy eyes he had ever seen. And this was the first
      thing which disturbed the mental stagnation of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not affected personally. He merely thought that life without
      happiness is impossible. What was happiness? He yawned and went on
      shuffling about and about between the walls of his room. Looking forward
      was happiness&mdash;that&rsquo;s all&mdash;nothing more. To look forward to the
      gratification of some desire, to the gratification of some passion, love,
      ambition, hate&mdash;hate too indubitably. Love and hate. And to escape
      the dangers of existence, to live without fear, was also happiness. There
      was nothing else. Absence of fear&mdash;looking forward. &ldquo;Oh! the
      miserable lot of humanity!&rdquo; he exclaimed mentally; and added at once in
      his thought, &ldquo;I ought to be happy enough as far as that goes.&rdquo; But he was
      not excited by that assurance. On the contrary, he yawned again as he had
      been yawning all day. He was mildly surprised to discover himself being
      overtaken by night. The room grew dark swiftly though time had seemed to
      stand still. How was it that he had not noticed the passing of that day?
      Of course, it was the watch being stopped....
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not light his lamp, but went over to the bed and threw himself on
      it without any hesitation. Lying on his back, he put his hands under his
      head and stared upward. After a moment he thought, &ldquo;I am lying here like
      that man. I wonder if he slept while I was struggling with the blizzard in
      the streets. No, he did not sleep. But why should I not sleep?&rdquo; and he
      felt the silence of the night press upon all his limbs like a weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the calm of the hard frost outside, the clear-cut strokes of the town
      clock counting off midnight penetrated the quietness of his suspended
      animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he began to think. It was twenty-four hours since that man left his
      room. Razumov had a distinct feeling that Haldin in the fortress was
      sleeping that night. It was a certitude which made him angry because he
      did not want to think of Haldin, but he justified it to himself by
      physiological and psychological reasons. The fellow had hardly slept for
      weeks on his own confession, and now every incertitude was at an end for
      him. No doubt he was looking forward to the consummation of his martyrdom.
      A man who resigns himself to kill need not go very far for resignation to
      die. Haldin slept perhaps more soundly than General T&mdash;-, whose task&mdash;weary
      work too&mdash;was not done, and over whose head hung the sword of
      revolutionary vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, remembering the thick-set man with his heavy jowl resting on the
      collar of his uniform, the champion of autocracy, who had let no sign of
      surprise, incredulity, or joy escape him, but whose goggle eyes could
      express a mortal hatred of all rebellion&mdash;Razumov moved uneasily on
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He suspected me,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I suppose he must suspect everybody. He
      would be capable of suspecting his own wife, if Haldin had gone to her
      boudoir with his confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov sat up in anguish. Was he to remain a political suspect all his
      days? Was he to go through life as a man not wholly to be trusted&mdash;with
      a bad secret police note tacked on to his record? What sort of future
      could he look forward to?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now a suspect,&rdquo; he thought again; but the habit of reflection and
      that desire of safety, of an ordered life, which was so strong in him came
      to his assistance as the night wore on. His quiet, steady, and laborious
      existence would vouch at length for his loyalty. There were many permitted
      ways to serve one&rsquo;s country. There was an activity that made for progress
      without being revolutionary. The field of influence was great and
      infinitely varied&mdash;once one had conquered a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thought like a circling bird reverted after four-and-twenty hours to
      the silver medal, and as it were poised itself there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day broke he had not slept, not for a moment, but he got up not
      very tired and quite sufficiently self-possessed for all practical
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out and attended three lectures in the morning. But the work in
      the library was a mere dumb show of research. He sat with many volumes
      open before him trying to make notes and extracts. His new tranquillity
      was like a flimsy garment, and seemed to float at the mercy of a casual
      word. Betrayal! Why! the fellow had done all that was necessary to betray
      himself. Precious little had been needed to deceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said no word to him that was not strictly true. Not one word,&rdquo;
       Razumov argued with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once engaged on this line of thought there could be no question of doing
      useful work. The same ideas went on passing through his mind, and he
      pronounced mentally the same words over and over again. He shut up all the
      books and rammed all his papers into his pocket with convulsive movements,
      raging inwardly against Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was leaving the library a long bony student in a threadbare overcoat
      joined him, stepping moodily by his side. Razumov answered his mumbled
      greeting without looking at him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he want with me?&rdquo; he thought with a strange dread of the
      unexpected which he tried to shake off lest it should fasten itself upon
      his life for good and all. And the other, muttering cautiously with
      downcast eyes, supposed that his comrade had seen the news of de P&mdash;-&rsquo;s
      executioner&mdash;that was the expression he used&mdash;having been
      arrested the night before last....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ill&mdash;shut up in my rooms,&rdquo; Razumov mumbled through his
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall student, raising his shoulders, shoved his hands deep into his
      pockets. He had a hairless, square, tallowy chin which trembled slightly
      as he spoke, and his nose nipped bright red by the sharp air looked like a
      false nose of painted cardboard between the sallow cheeks. His whole
      appearance was stamped with the mark of cold and hunger. He stalked
      deliberately at Razumov&rsquo;s elbow with his eyes on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an official statement,&rdquo; he continued in the same cautious mutter.
      &ldquo;It may be a lie. But there was somebody arrested between midnight and one
      in the morning on Tuesday. This is certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And talking rapidly under the cover of his downcast air, he told Razumov
      that this was known through an inferior Government clerk employed at the
      Central Secretariat. That man belonged to one of the revolutionary
      circles. &ldquo;The same, in fact, I am affiliated to,&rdquo; remarked the student.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were crossing a wide quadrangle. An infinite distress possessed
      Razumov, annihilated his energy, and before his eyes everything appeared
      confused and as if evanescent. He dared not leave the fellow there. &ldquo;He
      may be affiliated to the police,&rdquo; was the thought that passed through his
      mind. &ldquo;Who could tell?&rdquo; But eyeing the miserable frost-nipped,
      famine-struck figure of his companion he perceived the absurdity of his
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;you know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t belong to any circle. I....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dared not say any more. Neither dared he mend his pace. The other,
      raising and setting down his lamentably shod feet with exact deliberation,
      protested in a low tone that it was not necessary for everybody to belong
      to an organization. The most valuable personalities remained outside. Some
      of the best work was done outside the organization. Then very fast, with
      whispering, feverish lips&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man arrested in the street was Haldin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And accepting Razumov&rsquo;s dismayed silence as natural enough, he assured him
      that there was no mistake. That Government clerk was on night duty at the
      Secretariat. Hearing a great noise of footsteps in the hall and aware that
      political prisoners were brought over sometimes at night from the
      fortress, he opened the door of the room in which he was working,
      suddenly. Before the gendarme on duty could push him back and slam the
      door in his face, he had seen a prisoner being partly carried, partly
      dragged along the hall by a lot of policemen. He was being used very
      brutally. And the clerk had recognized Haldin perfectly. Less than half an
      hour afterwards General T&mdash;- arrived at the Secretariat to examine
      that prisoner personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you astonished?&rdquo; concluded the gaunt student.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Razumov roughly&mdash;and at once regretted his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody supposed Haldin was in the provinces&mdash;with his people.
      Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The student turned his big hollow eyes upon Razumov, who said unguardedly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His people are abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could have bitten his tongue out with vexation. The student pronounced
      in a tone of profound meaning&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! You alone were aware,...&rdquo; and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have sworn my ruin,&rdquo; thought Razumov. &ldquo;Have you spoken of this to
      anyone else?&rdquo; he asked with bitter curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only to you. Our circle thought that as Haldin had been often heard
      expressing a warm appreciation of your character....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov could not restrain a gesture of angry despair which the other must
      have misunderstood in some way, because he ceased speaking and turned away
      his black, lack-lustre eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved side by side in silence. Then the gaunt student began to
      whisper again, with averted gaze&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we have at present no one affiliated inside the fortress so as to make
      it possible to furnish him with a packet of poison, we have considered
      already some sort of retaliatory action&mdash;to follow very soon....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov trudging on interrupted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you acquainted with Haldin? Did he know where you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the happiness to hear him speak twice,&rdquo; his companion answered in
      the feverish whisper contrasting with the gloomy apathy of his face and
      bearing. &ldquo;He did not know where I live.... I am lodging poorly with an
      artisan family.... I have just a corner in a room. It is not very
      practicable to see me there, but if you should need me for anything I am
      ready....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov trembled with rage and fear. He was beside himself, but kept his
      voice low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not to come near me. You are not to speak to me. Never address a
      single word to me. I forbid you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the other submissively, showing no surprise whatever at
      this abrupt prohibition. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wish for secret reasons...
      perfectly... I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He edged away at once, not looking up even; and Razumov saw his gaunt,
      shabby, famine-stricken figure cross the street obliquely with lowered
      head and that peculiar exact motion of the feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched him as one would watch a vision out of a nightmare, then he
      continued on his way, trying not to think. On his landing the landlady
      seemed to be waiting for him. She was a short, thick, shapeless woman with
      a large yellow face wrapped up everlastingly in a black woollen shawl.
      When she saw him come up the last flight of stairs she flung both her arms
      up excitedly, then clasped her hands before her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirylo Sidorovitch&mdash;little father&mdash;what have you been doing?
      And such a quiet young man, too! The police are just gone this moment
      after searching your rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov gazed down at her with silent, scrutinizing attention. Her puffy
      yellow countenance was working with emotion. She screwed up her eyes at
      him entreatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a sensible young man! Anybody can see you are sensible. And now&mdash;like
      this&mdash;all at once.... What is the good of mixing yourself up with
      these Nihilists? Do give over, little father. They are unlucky people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov moved his shoulders slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or is it that some secret enemy has been calumniating you, Kirylo
      Sidorovitch? The world is full of black hearts and false denunciations
      nowadays. There is much fear about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard that I have been denounced by some one?&rdquo; asked Razumov,
      without taking his eyes off her quivering face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had not heard anything. She had tried to find out by asking the
      police captain while his men were turning the room upside down. The police
      captain of the district had known her for the last eleven years and was a
      humane person. But he said to her on the landing, looking very black and
      vexed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good woman, do not ask questions. I don&rsquo;t know anything myself. The
      order comes from higher quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And indeed there had appeared, shortly after the arrival of the policemen
      of the district, a very superior gentleman in a fur coat and a shiny hat,
      who sat down in the room and looked through all the papers himself. He
      came alone and went away by himself, taking nothing with him. She had been
      trying to put things straight a little since they left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov turned away brusquely and entered his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his books had been shaken and thrown on the floor. His landlady
      followed him, and stooping painfully began to pick them up into her apron.
      His papers and notes which were kept always neatly sorted (they all
      related to his studies) had been shuffled up and heaped together into a
      ragged pile in the middle of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disorder affected him profoundly, unreasonably. He sat down and
      stared. He had a distinct sensation of his very existence being undermined
      in some mysterious manner, of his moral supports falling away from him one
      by one. He even experienced a slight physical giddiness and made a
      movement as if to reach for something to steady himself with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman, rising to her feet with a low groan, shot all the books she
      had collected in her apron on to the sofa and left the room muttering and
      sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only then that he noticed that the sheet of paper which for one
      night had remained stabbed to the wall above his empty bed was lying on
      top of the pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had taken it down the day before he had folded it in four,
      absent-mindedly, before dropping it on the table. And now he saw it lying
      uppermost, spread out, smoothed out even and covering all the confused
      pile of pages, the record of his intellectual life for the last three
      years. It had not been flung there. It had been placed there&mdash;smoothed
      out, too! He guessed in that an intention of profound meaning&mdash;or
      perhaps some inexplicable mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat staring at the piece of paper till his eyes began to smart. He did
      not attempt to put his papers in order, either that evening or the next
      day&mdash;which he spent at home in a state of peculiar irresolution. This
      irresolution bore upon the question whether he should continue to live&mdash;neither
      more nor less. But its nature was very far removed from the hesitation of
      a man contemplating suicide. The idea of laying violent hands upon his
      body did not occur to Razumov. The unrelated organism bearing that label,
      walking, breathing, wearing these clothes, was of no importance to anyone,
      unless maybe to the landlady. The true Razumov had his being in the
      willed, in the determined future&mdash;in that future menaced by the
      lawlessness of autocracy&mdash;for autocracy knows no law&mdash;and the
      lawlessness of revolution. The feeling that his moral personality was at
      the mercy of these lawless forces was so strong that he asked himself
      seriously if it were worth while to go on accomplishing the mental
      functions of that existence which seemed no longer his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the good of exerting my intelligence, of pursuing the systematic
      development of my faculties and all my plans of work?&rdquo; he asked himself.
      &ldquo;I want to guide my conduct by reasonable convictions, but what security
      have I against something&mdash;some destructive horror&mdash;walking in
      upon me as I sit here?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked apprehensively towards the door of the outer room as if
      expecting some shape of evil to turn the handle and appear before him
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A common thief,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;finds more guarantees in the law he
      is breaking, and even a brute like Ziemianitch has his consolation.&rdquo;
       Razumov envied the materialism of the thief and the passion of the
      incorrigible lover. The consequences of their actions were always clear
      and their lives remained their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he slept as soundly that night as though he had been consoling himself
      in the manner of Ziemianitch. He dropped off suddenly, lay like a log,
      remembered no dream on waking. But it was as if his soul had gone out in
      the night to gather the flowers of wrathful wisdom. He got up in a mood of
      grim determination and as if with a new knowledge of his own nature. He
      looked mockingly on the heap of papers on his table; and left his room to
      attend the lectures, muttering to himself, &ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in no humour to talk to anybody or hear himself questioned as to
      his absence from lectures the day before. But it was difficult to repulse
      rudely a very good comrade with a smooth pink face and fair hair, bearing
      the nickname amongst his fellow-students of &ldquo;Madcap Kostia.&rdquo; He was the
      idolized only son of a very wealthy and illiterate Government contractor,
      and attended the lectures only during the periodical fits of contrition
      following upon tearful paternal remonstrances. Noisily blundering like a
      retriever puppy, his elated voice and great gestures filled the bare
      academy corridors with the joy of thoughtless animal life, provoking
      indulgent smiles at a great distance. His usual discourses treated of
      trotting horses, wine-parties in expensive restaurants, and the merits of
      persons of easy virtue, with a disarming artlessness of outlook. He
      pounced upon Razumov about midday, somewhat less uproariously than his
      habit was, and led him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, Kirylo Sidorovitch. A few words here in this quiet
      corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt Razumov&rsquo;s reluctance, and insinuated his hand under his arm
      caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;pray do. I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you about any of my silly
      scrapes. What are my scrapes? Absolutely nothing. Mere childishness. The
      other night I flung a fellow out of a certain place where I was having a
      fairly good time. A tyrannical little beast of a quill-driver from the
      Treasury department. He was bullying the people of the house. I rebuked
      him. &lsquo;You are not behaving humanely to God&rsquo;s creatures that are a jolly
      sight more estimable than yourself,&rsquo; I said. I can&rsquo;t bear to see any
      tyranny, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Upon my word I can&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t take it in
      good part at all. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that impudent puppy?&rsquo; he begins to shout. I was
      in excellent form as it happened, and he went through the closed window
      very suddenly. He flew quite a long way into the yard. I raged like&mdash;like
      a&mdash;minotaur. The women clung to me and screamed, the fiddlers got
      under the table.... Such fun! My dad had to put his hand pretty deep into
      his pocket, I can tell you.&rdquo; He chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dad is a very useful man. Jolly good thing it is for me, too. I do get
      into unholy scrapes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His elation fell. That was just it. What was his life? Insignificant; no
      good to anyone; a mere festivity. It would end some fine day in his
      getting his skull split with a champagne bottle in a drunken brawl. At
      such times, too, when men were sacrificing themselves to ideas. But he
      could never get any ideas into his head. His head wasn&rsquo;t worth anything
      better than to be split by a champagne bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, protesting that he had no time, made an attempt to get away. The
      other&rsquo;s tone changed to confidential earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Kirylo, my dear soul, let me make some sort of sacrifice.
      It would not be a sacrifice really. I have my rich dad behind me. There&rsquo;s
      positively no getting to the bottom of his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And rejecting indignantly Razumov&rsquo;s suggestion that this was drunken
      raving, he offered to lend him some money to escape abroad with. He could
      always get money from his dad. He had only to say that he had lost it at
      cards or something of that sort, and at the same time promise solemnly not
      to miss a single lecture for three months on end. That would fetch the old
      man; and he, Kostia, was quite equal to the sacrifice. Though he really
      did not see what was the good for him to attend the lectures. It was
      perfectly hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me be of some use?&rdquo; he pleaded to the silent Razumov, who
      with his eyes on the ground and utterly unable to penetrate the real drift
      of the other&rsquo;s intention, felt a strange reluctance to clear up the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think I want to go abroad?&rdquo; he asked at last very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kostia lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had the police in your rooms yesterday. There are three or four of us
      who have heard of that. Never mind how we know. It is sufficient that we
      do. So we have been consulting together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You got to know that so soon,&rdquo; muttered Razumov negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We did. And it struck us that a man like you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a man do you take me to be?&rdquo; Razumov interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of ideas&mdash;and a man of action too. But you are very deep,
      Kirylo. There&rsquo;s no getting to the bottom of your mind. Not for fellows
      like me. But we all agreed that you must be preserved for our country. Of
      that we have no doubt whatever&mdash;I mean all of us who have heard
      Haldin speak of you on certain occasions. A man doesn&rsquo;t get the police
      ransacking his rooms without there being some devilry hanging over his
      head.... And so if you think that it would be better for you to bolt at
      once....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov tore himself away and walked down the corridor, leaving the other
      motionless with his mouth open. But almost at once he returned and stood
      before the amazed Kostia, who shut his mouth slowly. Razumov looked him
      straight in the eyes, before saying with marked deliberation and
      separating his words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank&mdash;you&mdash;very&mdash;much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went away again rapidly. Kostia, recovering from his surprise at these
      manoeuvres, ran up behind him pressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Wait! Listen. I really mean it. It would be like giving your
      compassion to a starving fellow. Do you hear, Kirylo? And any disguise you
      may think of, that too I could procure from a costumier, a Jew I know. Let
      a fool be made serviceable according to his folly. Perhaps also a false
      beard or something of that kind may be needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Razumov turned at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no false beards needed in this business, Kostia&mdash;you
      good-hearted lunatic, you. What do you know of my ideas? My ideas may be
      poison to you.&rdquo; The other began to shake his head in energetic protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got to do with ideas? Some of them would make an end of
      your dad&rsquo;s money-bags. Leave off meddling with what you don&rsquo;t understand.
      Go back to your trotting horses and your girls, and then you&rsquo;ll be sure at
      least of doing no harm to anybody, and hardly any to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The enthusiastic youth was overcome by this disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sending me back to my pig&rsquo;s trough, Kirylo. That settles it. I am
      an unlucky beast&mdash;and I shall die like a beast too. But mind&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      your contempt that has done for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov went off with long strides. That this simple and grossly festive
      soul should have fallen too under the revolutionary curse affected him as
      an ominous symptom of the time. He reproached himself for feeling
      troubled. Personally he ought to have felt reassured. There was an obvious
      advantage in this conspiracy of mistaken judgment taking him for what he
      was not. But was it not strange?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he experienced that sensation of his conduct being taken out of his
      hands by Haldin&rsquo;s revolutionary tyranny. His solitary and laborious
      existence had been destroyed&mdash;the only thing he could call his own on
      this earth. By what right? he asked himself furiously. In what name?
    </p>
    <p>
      What infuriated him most was to feel that the &ldquo;thinkers&rdquo; of the University
      were evidently connecting him with Haldin&mdash;as a sort of confidant in
      the background apparently. A mysterious connexion! Ha ha! ...He had been
      made a personage without knowing anything about it. How that wretch Haldin
      must have talked about him! Yet it was likely that Haldin had said very
      little. The fellow&rsquo;s casual utterances were caught up and treasured and
      pondered over by all these imbeciles. And was not all secret revolutionary
      action based upon folly, self-deception, and lies?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible to think of anything else,&rdquo; muttered Razumov to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      become an idiot if this goes on. The scoundrels and the fools are
      murdering my intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lost all hope of saving his future, which depended on the free use of
      his intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the doorway of his house in a state of mental discouragement
      which enabled him to receive with apparent indifference an
      official-looking envelope from the dirty hand of the dvornik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gendarme brought it,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;He asked if you were at home. I
      told him &lsquo;No, he&rsquo;s not at home.&rsquo; So he left it. &lsquo;Give it into his own
      hands,&rsquo; says he. Now you&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his sweeping, and Razumov climbed his stairs, envelope in
      hand. Once in his room he did not hasten to open it. Of course this
      official missive was from the superior direction of the police. A suspect!
      A suspect!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared in dreary astonishment at the absurdity of his position. He
      thought with a sort of dry, unemotional melancholy; three years of good
      work gone, the course of forty more perhaps jeopardized&mdash;turned from
      hope to terror, because events started by human folly link themselves into
      a sequence which no sagacity can foresee and no courage can break through.
      Fatality enters your rooms while your landlady&rsquo;s back is turned; you come
      home and find it in possession bearing a man&rsquo;s name, clothed in flesh&mdash;wearing
      a brown cloth coat and long boots&mdash;lounging against the stove. It
      asks you, &ldquo;Is the outer door closed?&rdquo;&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t know enough to
      take it by the throat and fling it downstairs. You don&rsquo;t know. You welcome
      the crazy fate. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; you say. And it is all over. You cannot shake
      it off any more. It will cling to you for ever. Neither halter nor bullet
      can give you back the freedom of your life and the sanity of your
      thought.... It was enough to dash one&rsquo;s head against a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked slowly all round the walls as if to select a spot to dash
      his head against. Then he opened the letter. It directed the student
      Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov to present himself without delay at the General
      Secretariat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had a vision of General T&mdash;-&rsquo;s goggle eyes waiting for him&mdash;the
      embodied power of autocracy, grotesque and terrible. He embodied the whole
      power of autocracy because he was its guardian. He was the incarnate
      suspicion, the incarnate anger, the incarnate ruthlessness of a political
      and social regime on its defence. He loathed rebellion by instinct. And
      Razumov reflected that the man was simply unable to understand a
      reasonable adherence to the doctrine of absolutism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can he want with me precisely&mdash;I wonder?&rdquo; he asked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if that mental question had evoked the familiar phantom, Haldin stood
      suddenly before him in the room with an extraordinary completeness of
      detail. Though the short winter day had passed already into the sinister
      twilight of a land buried in snow, Razumov saw plainly the narrow leather
      strap round the Tcherkess coat. The illusion of that hateful presence was
      so perfect that he half expected it to ask, &ldquo;Is the outer door closed?&rdquo; He
      looked at it with hatred and contempt. Souls do not take a shape of
      clothing. Moreover, Haldin could not be dead yet. Razumov stepped forward
      menacingly; the vision vanished&mdash;and turning short on his heel he
      walked out of his room with infinite disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after going down the first flight of stairs it occurred to him that
      perhaps the superior authorities of police meant to confront him with
      Haldin in the flesh. This thought struck him like a bullet, and had he not
      clung with both hands to the banister he would have rolled down to the
      next landing most likely. His legs were of no use for a considerable
      time.... But why? For what conceivable reason? To what end?
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no rational answer to these questions; but Razumov
      remembered the promise made by the General to Prince K&mdash;-. His action
      was to remain unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got down to the bottom of the stairs, lowering himself as it were from
      step to step, by the banister. Under the gate he regained much of his
      firmness of thought and limb. He went out into the street without
      staggering visibly. Every moment he felt steadier mentally. And yet he was
      saying to himself that General T&mdash;- was perfectly capable of shutting
      him up in the fortress for an indefinite time. His temperament fitted his
      remorseless task, and his omnipotence made him inaccessible to reasonable
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Razumov arrived at the Secretariat he discovered that he would
      have nothing to do with General T&mdash;-. It is evident from Mr.
      Razumov&rsquo;s diary that this dreaded personality was to remain in the
      background. A civilian of superior rank received him in a private room
      after a period of waiting in outer offices where a lot of scribbling went
      on at many tables in a heated and stuffy atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk in uniform who conducted him said in the corridor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going before Gregor Matvieitch Mikulin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing formidable about the man bearing that name. His mild,
      expectant glance was turned on the door already when Razumov entered. At
      once, with the penholder he was holding in his hand, he pointed to a deep
      sofa between two windows. He followed Razumov with his eyes while that
      last crossed the room and sat down. The mild gaze rested on him, not
      curious, not inquisitive&mdash;certainly not suspicious&mdash;almost
      without expression. In its passionless persistence there was something
      resembling sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, who had prepared his will and his intelligence to encounter
      General T&mdash;- himself, was profoundly troubled. All the moral bracing
      up against the possible excesses of power and passion went for nothing
      before this sallow man, who wore a full unclipped beard. It was fair,
      thin, and very fine. The light fell in coppery gleams on the protuberances
      of a high, rugged forehead. And the aspect of the broad, soft physiognomy
      was so homely and rustic that the careful middle parting of the hair
      seemed a pretentious affectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diary of Mr. Razumov testifies to some irritation on his part. I may
      remark here that the diary proper consisting of the more or less daily
      entries seems to have been begun on that very evening after Mr. Razumov
      had returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Razumov, then, was irritated. His strung-up individuality had gone to
      pieces within him very suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be very prudent with him,&rdquo; he warned himself in the silence during
      which they sat gazing at each other. It lasted some little time, and was
      characterized (for silences have their character) by a sort of sadness
      imparted to it perhaps by the mild and thoughtful manner of the bearded
      official. Razumov learned later that he was the chief of a department in
      the General Secretariat, with a rank in the civil service equivalent to
      that of a colonel in the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov&rsquo;s mistrust became acute. The main point was, not to be drawn into
      saying too much. He had been called there for some reason. What reason? To
      be given to understand that he was a suspect&mdash;and also no doubt to be
      pumped. As to what precisely? There was nothing. Or perhaps Haldin had
      been telling lies.... Every alarming uncertainty beset Razumov. He could
      bear the silence no longer, and cursing himself for his weakness spoke
      first, though he had promised himself not to do so on any account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t lost a moment&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; he began in a hoarse, provoking tone;
      and then the faculty of speech seemed to leave him and enter the body of
      Councillor Mikulin, who chimed in approvingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very proper. Very proper. Though as a matter of fact....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the spell was broken, and Razumov interrupted him boldly, under a
      sudden conviction that this was the safest attitude to take. With a great
      flow of words he complained of being totally misunderstood. Even as he
      talked with a perception of his own audacity he thought that the word
      &ldquo;misunderstood&rdquo; was better than the word &ldquo;mistrusted,&rdquo; and he repeated it
      again with insistence. Suddenly he ceased, being seized with fright before
      the attentive immobility of the official. &ldquo;What am I talking about?&rdquo; he
      thought, eyeing him with a vague gaze. Mistrusted&mdash;not misunderstood&mdash;was
      the right symbol for these people. Misunderstood was the other kind of
      curse. Both had been brought on his head by that fellow Haldin. And his
      head ached terribly. He passed his hand over his brow&mdash;an involuntary
      gesture of suffering, which he was too careless to restrain. At that
      moment Razumov beheld his own brain suffering on the rack&mdash;a long,
      pale figure drawn asunder horizontally with terrific force in the darkness
      of a vault, whose face he failed to see. It was as though he had dreamed
      for an infinitesimal fraction of time of some dark print of the
      Inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not to be seriously supposed that Razumov had actually dozed off and
      had dreamed in the presence of Councillor Mikulin, of an old print of the
      Inquisition. He was indeed extremely exhausted, and he records a
      remarkably dream-like experience of anguish at the circumstance that there
      was no one whatever near the pale and extended figure. The solitude of the
      racked victim was particularly horrible to behold. The mysterious
      impossibility to see the face, he also notes, inspired a sort of terror.
      All these characteristics of an ugly dream were present. Yet he is certain
      that he never lost the consciousness of himself on the sofa, leaning
      forward with his hands between his knees and turning his cap round and
      round in his fingers. But everything vanished at the voice of Councillor
      Mikulin. Razumov felt profoundly grateful for the even simplicity of its
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have listened with interest. I comprehend in a measure your...
      But, indeed, you are mistaken in what you....&rdquo; Councillor Mikulin uttered
      a series of broken sentences. Instead of finishing them he glanced down
      his beard. It was a deliberate curtailment which somehow made the phrases
      more impressive. But he could talk fluently enough, as became apparent
      when changing his tone to persuasiveness he went on: &ldquo;By listening to you
      as I did, I think I have proved that I do not regard our intercourse as
      strictly official. In fact, I don&rsquo;t want it to have that character at
      all.... Oh yes! I admit that the request for your presence here had an
      official form. But I put it to you whether it was a form which would have
      been used to secure the attendance of a....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspect,&rdquo; exclaimed Razumov, looking straight into the official&rsquo;s eyes.
      They were big with heavy eyelids, and met his boldness with a dim,
      steadfast gaze. &ldquo;A suspect.&rdquo; The open repetition of that word which had
      been haunting all his waking hours gave Razumov a strange sort of
      satisfaction. Councillor Mikulin shook his head slightly. &ldquo;Surely you do
      know that I&rsquo;ve had my rooms searched by the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to say a &lsquo;misunderstood person,&rsquo; when you interrupted me,&rdquo;
       insinuated quietly Councillor Mikulin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov smiled without bitterness. The renewed sense of his intellectual
      superiority sustained him in the hour of danger. He said a little
      disdainfully&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am but a reed. But I beg you to allow me the superiority of the
      thinking reed over the unthinking forces that are about to crush him out
      of existence. Practical thinking in the last instance is but criticism. I
      may perhaps be allowed to express my wonder at this action of the police
      being delayed for two full days during which, of course, I could have
      annihilated everything compromising by burning it&mdash;let us say&mdash;and
      getting rid of the very ashes, for that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are angry,&rdquo; remarked the official, with an unutterable simplicity of
      tone and manner. &ldquo;Is that reasonable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov felt himself colouring with annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am reasonable. I am even&mdash;permit me to say&mdash;a thinker, though
      to be sure, this name nowadays seems to be the monopoly of hawkers of
      revolutionary wares, the slaves of some French or German thought&mdash;devil
      knows what foreign notions. But I am not an intellectual mongrel. I think
      like a Russian. I think faithfully&mdash;and I take the liberty to call
      myself a thinker. It is not a forbidden word, as far as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why should it be a forbidden word?&rdquo; Councillor Mikulin turned in his
      seat with crossed legs and resting his elbow on the table propped his head
      on the knuckles of a half-closed hand. Razumov noticed a thick forefinger
      clasped by a massive gold band set with a blood-red stone&mdash;a signet
      ring that, looking as if it could weigh half a pound, was an appropriate
      ornament for that ponderous man with the accurate middle-parting of glossy
      hair above a rugged Socratic forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could it be a wig?&rdquo; Razumov detected himself wondering with an unexpected
      detachment. His self-confidence was much shaken. He resolved to chatter no
      more. Reserve! Reserve! All he had to do was to keep the Ziemianitch
      episode secret with absolute determination, when the questions came. Keep
      Ziemianitch strictly out of all the answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin looked at him dimly. Razumov&rsquo;s self-confidence
      abandoned him completely. It seemed impossible to keep Ziemianitch out.
      Every question would lead to that, because, of course, there was nothing
      else. He made an effort to brace himself up. It was a failure. But
      Councillor Mikulin was surprisingly detached too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it be forbidden?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I too consider myself a
      thinking man, I assure you. The principal condition is to think correctly.
      I admit it is difficult sometimes at first for a young man abandoned to
      himself&mdash;with his generous impulses undisciplined, so to speak&mdash;at
      the mercy of every wild wind that blows. Religious belief, of course, is a
      great....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin glanced down his beard, and Razumov, whose tension was
      relaxed by that unexpected and discursive turn, murmured with gloomy
      discontent&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man, Haldin, believed in God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You are aware,&rdquo; breathed out Councillor Mikulin, making the point
      softly, as if with discretion, but making it nevertheless plainly enough,
      as if he too were put off his guard by Razumov&rsquo;s remark. The young man
      preserved an impassive, moody countenance, though he reproached himself
      bitterly for a pernicious fool, to have given thus an utterly false
      impression of intimacy. He kept his eyes on the floor. &ldquo;I must positively
      hold my tongue unless I am obliged to speak,&rdquo; he admonished himself. And
      at once against his will the question, &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better tell him
      everything?&rdquo; presented itself with such force that he had to bite his
      lower lip. Councillor Mikulin could not, however, have nourished any hope
      of confession. He went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me more than his judges were able to get out of him. He was
      judged by a commission of three. He would tell them absolutely nothing. I
      have the report of the interrogatories here, by me. After every question
      there stands &lsquo;Refuses to answer&mdash;refuses to answer.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s like that
      page after page. You see, I have been entrusted with some further
      investigations around and about this affair. He has left me nothing to
      begin my investigations on. A hardened miscreant. And so, you say, he
      believed in....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Councillor Mikulin glanced down his beard with a faint grimace; but
      he did not pause for long. Remarking with a shade of scorn that
      blasphemers also had that sort of belief, he concluded by supposing that
      Mr. Razumov had conversed frequently with Haldin on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Razumov loudly, without looking up. &ldquo;He talked and I listened.
      That is not a conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listening is a great art,&rdquo; observed Mikulin parenthetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And getting people to talk is another,&rdquo; mumbled Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;that is not very difficult,&rdquo; Mikulin said innocently,
      &ldquo;except, of course, in special cases. For instance, this Haldin. Nothing
      could induce him to talk. He was brought four times before the delegated
      judges. Four secret interrogatories&mdash;and even during the last, when
      your personality was put forward....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My personality put forward?&rdquo; repeated Razumov, raising his head
      brusquely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; Councillor Mikulin turned squarely to the
      table, and taking up some sheets of grey foolscap dropped them one after
      another, retaining only the last in his hand. He held it before his eyes
      while speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;you see&mdash;judged necessary. In a case of that gravity no
      means of action upon the culprit should be neglected. You understand that
      yourself, I am certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Razumov stared with enormous wide eyes at the side view of Councillor
      Mikulin, who now was not looking at him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was decided (I was consulted by General T&mdash;-) that a certain
      question should be put to the accused. But in deference to the earnest
      wishes of Prince K&mdash;- your name has been kept out of the documents
      and even from the very knowledge of the judges themselves. Prince K&mdash;-
      recognized the propriety, the necessity of what we proposed to do, but he
      was concerned for your safety. Things do leak out&mdash;that we can&rsquo;t
      deny. One cannot always answer for the discretion of inferior officials.
      There was, of course, the secretary of the special tribunal&mdash;one or
      two gendarmes in the room. Moreover, as I have said, in deference to
      Prince K&mdash;- even the judges themselves were to be left in ignorance.
      The question ready framed was sent to them by General T&mdash;- (I wrote
      it out with my own hand) with instructions to put it to the prisoner the
      very last of all. Here it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Councillor Mikulin threw back his head into proper focus and went on
      reading monotonously: &lsquo;Question&mdash;Has the man well known to you, in
      whose rooms you remained for several hours on Monday and on whose
      information you have been arrested&mdash;has he had any previous knowledge
      of your intention to commit a political murder?...&rsquo; Prisoner refuses to
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question repeated. Prisoner preserves the same stubborn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The venerable Chaplain of the Fortress being then admitted and exhorting
      the prisoner to repentance, entreating him also to atone for his crime by
      an unreserved and full confession which should help to liberate from the
      sin of rebellion against the Divine laws and the sacred Majesty of the
      Ruler, our Christ-loving land&mdash;the prisoner opens his lips for the
      first time during this morning&rsquo;s audience and in a loud, clear voice
      rejects the venerable Chaplain&rsquo;s ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock the Court pronounces in summary form the death
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The execution is fixed for four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, subject to
      further instructions from superior authorities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin dropped the page of foolscap, glanced down his beard,
      and turning to Razumov, added in an easy, explanatory tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw no object in delaying the execution. The order to carry out the
      sentence was sent by telegraph at noon. I wrote out the telegram myself.
      He was hanged at four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The definite information of Haldin&rsquo;s death gave Razumov the feeling of
      general lassitude which follows a great exertion or a great excitement. He
      kept very still on the sofa, but a murmur escaped him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a belief in a future existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin shrugged his shoulders slightly, and Razumov got up
      with an effort. There was nothing now to stay for in that room. Haldin had
      been hanged at four o&rsquo;clock. There could be no doubt of that. He had, it
      seemed, entered upon his future existence, long boots, Astrakhan fur cap
      and all, down to the very leather strap round his waist. A flickering,
      vanishing sort of existence. It was not his soul, it was his mere phantom
      he had left behind on this earth&mdash;thought Razumov, smiling
      caustically to himself while he crossed the room, utterly forgetful of
      where he was and of Councillor Mikulin&rsquo;s existence. The official could
      have set a lot of bells ringing all over the building without leaving his
      chair. He let Razumov go quite up to the door before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Kirylo Sidorovitch&mdash;what are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov turned his head and looked at him in silence. He was not in the
      least disconcerted. Councillor Mikulin&rsquo;s arms were stretched out on the
      table before him and his body leaned forward a little with an effort of
      his dim gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I actually going to clear out like this?&rdquo; Razumov wondered at himself
      with an impassive countenance. And he was aware of this impassiveness
      concealing a lucid astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently I was going out if he had not spoken,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What would
      he have done then? I must end this affair one way or another. I must make
      him show his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment longer he reflected behind the mask as it were, then let go
      the door-handle and came back to the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you think,&rdquo; he said explosively, but not raising his
      voice. &ldquo;You think that you are dealing with a secret accomplice of that
      unhappy man. No, I do not know that he was unhappy. He did not tell me. He
      was a wretch from my point of view, because to keep alive a false idea is
      a greater crime than to kill a man. I suppose you will not deny that? I
      hated him! Visionaries work everlasting evil on earth. Their Utopias
      inspire in the mass of mediocre minds a disgust of reality and a contempt
      for the secular logic of human development.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov shrugged his shoulders and stared. &ldquo;What a tirade!&rdquo; he thought.
      The silence and immobility of Councillor Mikulin impressed him. The
      bearded bureaucrat sat at his post, mysteriously self-possessed like an
      idol with dim, unreadable eyes. Razumov&rsquo;s voice changed involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to ask me where is the necessity of my hate for such as
      Haldin, I would answer you&mdash;there is nothing sentimental in it. I did
      not hate him because he had committed the crime of murder. Abhorrence is
      not hate. I hated him simply because I am sane. It is in that character
      that he outraged me. His death...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov felt his voice growing thick in his throat. The dimness of
      Councillor Mikulin&rsquo;s eyes seemed to spread all over his face and made it
      indistinct to Razumov&rsquo;s sight. He tried to disregard these phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he pursued, pronouncing each word carefully, &ldquo;what is his death
      to me? If he were lying here on the floor I could walk over his breast....
      The fellow is a mere phantom....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov&rsquo;s voice died out very much against his will. Mikulin behind the
      table did not allow himself the slightest movement. The silence lasted for
      some little time before Razumov could go on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went about talking of me. Those intellectual fellows sit in each
      other&rsquo;s rooms and get drunk on foreign ideas in the same way young Guards&rsquo; 
      officers treat each other with foreign wines. Merest debauchery. ...Upon
      my Word,&rdquo;&mdash;Razumov, enraged by a sudden recollection of Ziemianitch,
      lowered his voice forcibly,&mdash;&ldquo;upon my word, we Russians are a drunken
      lot. Intoxication of some sort we must have: to get ourselves wild with
      sorrow or maudlin with resignation; to lie inert like a log or set fire to
      the house. What is a sober man to do, I should like to know? To cut
      oneself entirely from one&rsquo;s kind is impossible. To live in a desert one
      must be a saint. But if a drunken man runs out of the grog-shop, falls on
      your neck and kisses you on both cheeks because something about your
      appearance has taken his fancy, what then&mdash;kindly tell me? You may
      break, perhaps, a cudgel on his back and yet not succeed in beating him
      off....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin raised his hand and passed it down his face
      deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s... of course,&rdquo; he said in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet gravity of that gesture made Razumov pause. It was so
      unexpected, too. What did it mean? It had an alarming aloofness. Razumov
      remembered his intention of making him show his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said all this to Prince K&mdash;-,&rdquo; he began with assumed
      indifference, but lost it on seeing Councillor Mikulin&rsquo;s slow nod of
      assent. &ldquo;You know it? You&rsquo;ve heard.... Then why should I be called here to
      be told of Haldin&rsquo;s execution? Did you want to confront me with his
      silence now that the man is dead? What is his silence to me! This is
      incomprehensible. You want in some way to shake my moral balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not that,&rdquo; murmured Councillor Mikulin, just audibly. &ldquo;The service
      you have rendered is appreciated....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; interrupted Razumov ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...and your position too.&rdquo; Councillor Mikulin did not raise his voice.
      &ldquo;But only think! You fall into Prince K&mdash;-&rsquo;s study as if from the sky
      with your startling information.... You are studying yet, Mr. Razumov, but
      we are serving already&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that.... And naturally some
      curiosity was bound to....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin looked down his beard. Razumov&rsquo;s lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An occurrence of that sort marks a man,&rdquo; the homely murmur went on. &ldquo;I
      admit I was curious to see you. General T&mdash;- thought it would be
      useful, too.... Don&rsquo;t think I am incapable of understanding your
      sentiments. When I was young like you I studied....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you wished to see me,&rdquo; said Razumov in a tone of profound
      distaste. &ldquo;Naturally you have the right&mdash;I mean the power. It all
      amounts to the same thing. But it is perfectly useless, if you were to
      look at me and listen to me for a year. I begin to think there is
      something about me which people don&rsquo;t seem able to make out. It&rsquo;s
      unfortunate. I imagine, however, that Prince K&mdash;- understands. He
      seemed to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin moved slightly and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince K&mdash;- is aware of everything that is being done, and I don&rsquo;t
      mind informing you that he approved my intention of becoming personally
      acquainted with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov concealed an immense disappointment under the accents of railing
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is curious too!... Well&mdash;after all, Prince K&mdash;- knows me
      very little. It is really very unfortunate for me, but&mdash;it is not
      exactly my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin raised a hasty deprecatory hand and inclined his head
      slightly over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Razumov&mdash;is it necessary to take it in that way? Everybody
      I am sure can....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced rapidly down his beard, and when he looked up again there was
      for a moment an interested expression in his misty gaze. Razumov
      discouraged it with a cold, repellent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s of no importance to be sure&mdash;except that in respect of
      all this curiosity being aroused by a very simple matter.... What is to be
      done with it? It is unappeasable. I mean to say there is nothing to
      appease it with. I happen to have been born a Russian with patriotic
      instincts&mdash;whether inherited or not I am not in a position to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov spoke consciously with elaborate steadiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, patriotic instincts developed by a faculty of independent thinking&mdash;of
      detached thinking. In that respect I am more free than any social
      democratic revolution could make me. It is more than probable that I don&rsquo;t
      think exactly as you are thinking. Indeed, how could it be? You would
      think most likely at this moment that I am elaborately lying to cover up
      the track of my repentance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov stopped. His heart had grown too big for his breast. Councillor
      Mikulin did not flinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;I assisted personally at the search of your
      rooms. I looked through all the papers myself. I have been greatly
      impressed by a sort of political confession of faith. A very remarkable
      document. Now may I ask for what purpose....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To deceive the police naturally,&rdquo; said Razumov savagely.... &ldquo;What is all
      this mockery? Of course you can send me straight from this room to
      Siberia. That would be intelligible. To what is intelligible I can submit.
      But I protest against this comedy of persecution. The whole affair is
      becoming too comical altogether for my taste. A comedy of errors,
      phantoms, and suspicions. It&rsquo;s positively indecent....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin turned an attentive ear. &ldquo;Did you say phantoms?&rdquo; he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could walk over dozens of them.&rdquo; Razumov, with an impatient wave of his
      hand, went on headlong, &ldquo;But, really, I must claim the right to be done
      once for all with that man. And in order to accomplish this I shall take
      the liberty....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov on his side of the table bowed slightly to the seated bureaucrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... To retire&mdash;simply to retire,&rdquo; he finished with great resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the door, thinking, &ldquo;Now he must show his hand. He must ring
      and have me arrested before I am out of the building, or he must let me
      go. And either way....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unhurried voice said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirylo Sidorovitch.&rdquo; Razumov at the door turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To retire,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Councillor Mikulin softly.

      PART SECOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      In the conduct of an invented story there are, no doubt, certain
      proprieties to be observed for the sake of clearness and effect. A man of
      imagination, however inexperienced in the art of narrative, has his
      instinct to guide him in the choice of his words, and in the development
      of the action. A grain of talent excuses many mistakes. But this is not a
      work of imagination; I have no talent; my excuse for this undertaking lies
      not in its art, but in its artlessness. Aware of my limitations and strong
      in the sincerity of my purpose, I would not try (were I able) to invent
      anything. I push my scruples so far that I would not even invent a
      transition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping then Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s record at the point where Councillor Mikulin&rsquo;s
      question &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; comes in with the force of an insoluble problem, I
      shall simply say that I made the acquaintance of these ladies about six
      months before that time. By &ldquo;these ladies&rdquo; I mean, of course, the mother
      and the sister of the unfortunate Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what arguments he had induced his mother to sell their little property
      and go abroad for an indefinite time, I cannot tell precisely. I have an
      idea that Mrs. Haldin, at her son&rsquo;s wish, would have set fire to her house
      and emigrated to the moon without any sign of surprise or apprehension;
      and that Miss Haldin&mdash;Nathalie, caressingly Natalka&mdash;would have
      given her assent to the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their proud devotion to that young man became clear to me in a very short
      time. Following his directions they went straight to Switzerland&mdash;to
      Zurich&mdash;where they remained the best part of a year. From Zurich,
      which they did not like, they came to Geneva. A friend of mine in
      Lausanne, a lecturer in history at the University (he had married a
      Russian lady, a distant connection of Mrs. Haldin&rsquo;s), wrote to me
      suggesting I should call on these ladies. It was a very kindly meant
      business suggestion. Miss Haldin wished to go through a course of reading
      the best English authors with a competent teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldin received me very kindly. Her bad French, of which she was
      smilingly conscious, did away with the formality of the first interview.
      She was a tall woman in a black silk dress. A wide brow, regular features,
      and delicately cut lips, testified to her past beauty. She sat upright in
      an easy chair and in a rather weak, gentle voice told me that her Natalka
      simply thirsted after knowledge. Her thin hands were lying on her lap, her
      facial immobility had in it something monachal. &ldquo;In Russia,&rdquo; she went on,
      &ldquo;all knowledge was tainted with falsehood. Not chemistry and all that, but
      education generally,&rdquo; she explained. The Government corrupted the teaching
      for its own purposes. Both her children felt that. Her Natalka had
      obtained a diploma of a Superior School for Women and her son was a
      student at the St. Petersburg University. He had a brilliant intellect, a
      most noble unselfish nature, and he was the oracle of his comrades. Early
      next year, she hoped he would join them and they would then go to Italy
      together. In any other country but their own she would have been certain
      of a great future for a man with the extraordinary abilities and the lofty
      character of her son&mdash;but in Russia....
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady sitting by the window turned her head and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, mother. Even with us things change with years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was deep, almost harsh, and yet caressing in its harshness. She
      had a dark complexion, with red lips and a full figure. She gave the
      impression of strong vitality. The old lady sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are both young&mdash;you two. It is easy for you to hope. But I, too,
      am not hopeless. Indeed, how could I be with a son like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I addressed Miss Haldin, asking her what authors she wished to read. She
      directed upon me her grey eyes shaded by black eyelashes, and I became
      aware, notwithstanding my years, how attractive physically her personality
      could be to a man capable of appreciating in a woman something else than
      the mere grace of femininity. Her glance was as direct and trustful as
      that of a young man yet unspoiled by the world&rsquo;s wise lessons. And it was
      intrepid, but in this intrepidity there was nothing aggressive. A naive
      yet thoughtful assurance is a better definition. She had reflected already
      (in Russia the young begin to think early), but she had never known
      deception as yet because obviously she had never yet fallen under the sway
      of passion. She was&mdash;to look at her was enough&mdash;very capable of
      being roused by an idea or simply by a person. At least, so I judged with
      I believe an unbiassed mind; for clearly my person could not be the person&mdash;and
      as to my ideas!...
    </p>
    <p>
      We became excellent friends in the course of our reading. It was very
      pleasant. Without fear of provoking a smile, I shall confess that I became
      very much attached to that young girl. At the end of four months I told
      her that now she could very well go on reading English by herself. It was
      time for the teacher to depart. My pupil looked unpleasantly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldin, with her immobility of feature and kindly expression of the
      eyes, uttered from her armchair in her uncertain French, &ldquo;<i>Mais l&rsquo;ami
      reviendra.</i>&rdquo; And so it was settled. I returned&mdash;not four times a
      week as before, but pretty frequently. In the autumn we made some short
      excursions together in company with other Russians. My friendship with
      these ladies gave me a standing in the Russian colony which otherwise I
      could not have had.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day I saw in the papers the news of Mr. de P&mdash;-&rsquo;s assassination&mdash;it
      was a Sunday&mdash;I met the two ladies in the street and walked with them
      for some distance. Mrs. Haldin wore a heavy grey cloak, I remember, over
      her black silk dress, and her fine eyes met mine with a very quiet
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been to the late service,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Natalka came with me. Her
      girl-friends, the students here, of course don&rsquo;t.... With us in Russia the
      church is so identified with oppression, that it seems almost necessary
      when one wishes to be free in this life, to give up all hope of a future
      existence. But I cannot give up praying for my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She added with a sort of stony grimness, colouring slightly, and in
      French, &ldquo;<i>Ce n&rsquo;est peut etre qu&rsquo;une habitude.</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;It may be only
      habit.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin was carrying the prayer-book. She did not glance at her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Victor are both profound believers,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I communicated to them the news from their country which I had just read
      in a cafe. For a whole minute we walked together fairly briskly in
      silence. Then Mrs. Haldin murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be more trouble, more persecutions for this. They may be even
      closing the University. There is neither peace nor rest in Russia for one
      but in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The way is hard,&rdquo; came from the daughter, looking straight before
      her at the Chain of Jura covered with snow, like a white wall closing the
      end of the street. &ldquo;But concord is not so very far off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what my children think,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Haldin to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not conceal my feeling that these were strange times to talk of
      concord. Nathalie Haldin surprised me by saying, as if she had thought
      very much on the subject, that the occidentals did not understand the
      situation. She was very calm and youthfully superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it is a class conflict, or a conflict of interests, as social
      contests are with you in Europe. But it is not that at all. It is
      something quite different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite possible that I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; I admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That propensity of lifting every problem from the plane of the
      understandable by means of some sort of mystic expression, is very
      Russian. I knew her well enough to have discovered her scorn for all the
      practical forms of political liberty known to the western world. I suppose
      one must be a Russian to understand Russian simplicity, a terrible
      corroding simplicity in which mystic phrases clothe a naive and hopeless
      cynicism. I think sometimes that the psychological secret of the profound
      difference of that people consists in this, that they detest life, the
      irremediable life of the earth as it is, whereas we westerners cherish it
      with perhaps an equal exaggeration of its sentimental value. But this is a
      digression indeed....
    </p>
    <p>
      I helped these ladies into the tramcar and they asked me to call in the
      afternoon. At least Mrs. Haldin asked me as she climbed up, and her
      Natalka smiled down at the dense westerner indulgently from the rear
      platform of the moving car. The light of the clear wintry forenoon was
      softened in her grey eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s record, like the open book of fate, revives for me the
      memory of that day as something startlingly pitiless in its freedom from
      all forebodings. Victor Haldin was still with the living, but with the
      living whose only contact with life is the expectation of death. He must
      have been already referring to the last of his earthly affections, the
      hours of that obstinate silence, which for him was to be prolonged into
      eternity. That afternoon the ladies entertained a good many of their
      compatriots&mdash;more than was usual for them to receive at one time; and
      the drawing-room on the ground floor of a large house on the Boulevard des
      Philosophes was very much crowded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I outstayed everybody; and when I rose Miss Haldin stood up too. I took
      her hand and was moved to revert to that morning&rsquo;s conversation in the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitting that we occidentals do not understand the character of your...&rdquo;
       I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if she had been prepared for me by some mysterious
      fore-knowledge. She checked me gently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their impulses&mdash;their...&rdquo; she sought the proper expression and found
      it, but in French...&ldquo;their <i>mouvements d&rsquo;ame.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was not much above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But still we are looking at a conflict. You say it
      is not a conflict of classes and not a conflict of interests. Suppose I
      admitted that. Are antagonistic ideas then to be reconciled more easily&mdash;can
      they be cemented with blood and violence into that concord which you
      proclaim to be so near?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me searchingly with her clear grey eyes, without answering
      my reasonable question&mdash;my obvious, my unanswerable question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is inconceivable,&rdquo; I added, with something like annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is inconceivable,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The whole world is inconceivable
      to the strict logic of ideas. And yet the world exists to our senses, and
      we exist in it. There must be a necessity superior to our conceptions. It
      is a very miserable and a very false thing to belong to the majority. We
      Russians shall find some better form of national freedom than an
      artificial conflict of parties&mdash;which is wrong because it is a
      conflict and contemptible because it is artificial. It is left for us
      Russians to discover a better way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldin had been looking out of the window. She turned upon me the
      almost lifeless beauty of her face, and the living benign glance of her
      big dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my children think,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I addressed Miss Haldin, &ldquo;that you will be shocked if I tell
      you that I haven&rsquo;t understood&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say a single word; I&rsquo;ve
      understood all the words.... But what can be this era of disembodied
      concord you are looking forward to. Life is a thing of form. It has its
      plastic shape and a definite intellectual aspect. The most idealistic
      conceptions of love and forbearance must be clothed in flesh as it were
      before they can be made understandable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took my leave of Mrs. Haldin, whose beautiful lips never stirred. She
      smiled with her eyes only. Nathalie Haldin went with me as far as the
      door, very amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother imagines that I am the slavish echo of my brother Victor. It is
      not so. He understands me better than I can understand him. When he joins
      us and you come to know him you will see what an exceptional soul it is.&rdquo;
       She paused. &ldquo;He is not a strong man in the conventional sense, you know,&rdquo;
       she added. &ldquo;But his character is without a flaw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that it will not be difficult for me to make friends with your
      brother Victor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect to understand him quite,&rdquo; she said, a little maliciously.
      &ldquo;He is not at all&mdash;at all&mdash;western at bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on this unnecessary warning I left the room with another bow in the
      doorway to Mrs. Haldin in her armchair by the window. The shadow of
      autocracy all unperceived by me had already fallen upon the Boulevard des
      Philosophes, in the free, independent and democratic city of Geneva, where
      there is a quarter called &ldquo;La Petite Russie.&rdquo; Whenever two Russians come
      together, the shadow of autocracy is with them, tinging their thoughts,
      their views, their most intimate feelings, their private life, their
      public utterances&mdash;haunting the secret of their silences.
    </p>
    <p>
      What struck me next in the course of a week or so was the silence of these
      ladies. I used to meet them walking in the public garden near the
      University. They greeted me with their usual friendliness, but I could not
      help noticing their taciturnity. By that time it was generally known that
      the assassin of M. de P&mdash;- had been caught, judged, and executed. So
      much had been declared officially to the news agencies. But for the world
      at large he remained anonymous. The official secrecy had withheld his name
      from the public. I really cannot imagine for what reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I saw Miss Haldin walking alone in the main valley of the Bastions
      under the naked trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is not very well,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Haldin had, it seemed, never had a day&rsquo;s illness in her life, this
      indisposition was disquieting. It was nothing definite, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she is fretting because we have not heard from my brother for
      rather a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No news&mdash;good news,&rdquo; I said cheerfully, and we began to walk slowly
      side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in Russia,&rdquo; she breathed out so low that I only just caught the
      words. I looked at her with more attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You too are anxious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She admitted after a moment of hesitation that she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really such a long time since we heard....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And before I could offer the usual banal suggestions she confided in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! But it is much worse than that. I wrote to a family we know in
      Petersburg. They had not seen him for more than a month. They thought he
      was already with us. They were even offended a little that he should have
      left Petersburg without calling on them. The husband of the lady went at
      once to his lodgings. Victor had left there and they did not know his
      address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember her catching her breath rather pitifully. Her brother had not
      been seen at lectures for a very long time either. He only turned up now
      and then at the University gate to ask the porter for his letters. And the
      gentleman friend was told that the student Haldin did not come to claim
      the last two letters for him. But the police came to inquire if the
      student Haldin ever received any correspondence at the University and took
      them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My two last letters,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We faced each other. A few snow-flakes fluttered under the naked boughs.
      The sky was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think could have happened?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her shoulders moved slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can never tell&mdash;in Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw then the shadow of autocracy lying upon Russian lives in their
      submission or their revolt. I saw it touch her handsome open face nestled
      in a fur collar and darken her clear eyes that shone upon me brilliantly
      grey in the murky light of a beclouded, inclement afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us move on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is cold standing&mdash;to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered a little and stamped her little feet. We moved briskly to
      the end of the alley and back to the great gates of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you told your mother?&rdquo; I ventured to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not yet. I came out to walk off the impression of this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard a rustle of paper somewhere. It came from her muff. She had the
      letter with her in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you are afraid of?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      To us Europeans of the West, all ideas of political plots and conspiracies
      seem childish, crude inventions for the theatre or a novel. I did not like
      to be more definite in my inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For us&mdash;for my mother specially, what I am afraid of is incertitude.
      People do disappear. Yes, they do disappear. I leave you to imagine what
      it is&mdash;the cruelty of the dumb weeks&mdash;months&mdash;years! This
      friend of ours has abandoned his inquiries when he heard of the police
      getting hold of the letters. I suppose he was afraid of compromising
      himself. He has a wife and children&mdash;and why should he, after all....
      Moreover, he is without influential connections and not rich. What could
      he do?... Yes, I am afraid of silence&mdash;for my poor mother. She won&rsquo;t
      be able to bear it. For my brother I am afraid of...&rdquo; she became almost
      indistinct, &ldquo;of anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were now near the gate opposite the theatre. She raised her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But lost people do turn up even in Russia. Do you know what my last hope
      is? Perhaps the next thing we know, we shall see him walking into our
      rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I raised my hat and she passed out of the gardens, graceful and strong,
      after a slight movement of the head to me, her hands in the muff,
      crumpling the cruel Petersburg letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning home I opened the newspaper I receive from London, and
      glancing down the correspondence from Russia&mdash;not the telegrams but
      the correspondence&mdash;the first thing that caught my eye was the name
      of Haldin. Mr. de P&mdash;-&rsquo;s death was no longer an actuality, but the
      enterprising correspondent was proud of having ferreted out some
      unofficial information about that fact of modern history. He had got hold
      of Haldin&rsquo;s name, and had picked up the story of the midnight arrest in
      the street. But the sensation from a journalistic point of view was
      already well in the past. He did not allot to it more than twenty lines
      out of a full column. It was quite enough to give me a sleepless night. I
      perceived that it would have been a sort of treason to let Miss Haldin
      come without preparation upon that journalistic discovery which would
      infallibly be reproduced on the morrow by French and Swiss newspapers. I
      had a very bad time of it till the morning, wakeful with nervous worry and
      night-marish with the feeling of being mixed up with something theatrical
      and morbidly affected. The incongruity of such a complication in those two
      women&rsquo;s lives was sensible to me all night in the form of absolute
      anguish. It seemed due to their refined simplicity that it should remain
      concealed from them for ever. Arriving at an unconscionably early hour at
      the door of their apartment, I felt as if I were about to commit an act of
      vandalism....
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle-aged servant woman led me into the drawing-room where there was
      a duster on a chair and a broom leaning against the centre table. The
      motes danced in the sunshine; I regretted I had not written a letter
      instead of coming myself, and was thankful for the brightness of the day.
      Miss Haldin in a plain black dress came lightly out of her mother&rsquo;s room
      with a fixed uncertain smile on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled the paper out of my pocket. I did not imagine that a number of
      the <i>Standard</i> could have the effect of Medusa&rsquo;s head. Her face went
      stony in a moment&mdash;her eyes&mdash;her limbs. The most terrible thing
      was that being stony she remained alive. One was conscious of her
      palpitating heart. I hope she forgave me the delay of my clumsy
      circumlocution. It was not very prolonged; she could not have kept so
      still from head to foot for more than a second or two; and then I heard
      her draw a breath. As if the shock had paralysed her moral resistance, and
      affected the firmness of her muscles, the contours of her face seemed to
      have given way. She was frightfully altered. She looked aged&mdash;ruined.
      But only for a moment. She said with decision&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell my mother at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that be safe in her state?&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be worse than the state she has been in for the last month? We
      understand this in another way. The crime is not at his door. Don&rsquo;t
      imagine I am defending him before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to the bedroom door, then came back to ask me in a low murmur not
      to go till she returned. For twenty interminable minutes not a sound
      reached me. At last Miss Haldin came out and walked across the room with
      her quick light step. When she reached the armchair she dropped into it
      heavily as if completely exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldin, she told me, had not shed a tear. She was sitting up in bed,
      and her immobility, her silence, were very alarming. At last she lay down
      gently and had motioned her daughter away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will call me in presently,&rdquo; added Miss Haldin. &ldquo;I left a bell near
      the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confess that my very real sympathy had no standpoint. The Western
      readers for whom this story is written will understand what I mean. It
      was, if I may say so, the want of experience. Death is a remorseless
      spoliator. The anguish of irreparable loss is familiar to us all. There is
      no life so lonely as to be safe against that experience. But the grief I
      had brought to these two ladies had gruesome associations. It had the
      associations of bombs and gallows&mdash;a lurid, Russian colouring which
      made the complexion of my sympathy uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was grateful to Miss Haldin for not embarrassing me by an outward
      display of deep feeling. I admired her for that wonderful command over
      herself, even while I was a little frightened at it. It was the stillness
      of a great tension. What if it should suddenly snap? Even the door of Mrs.
      Haldin&rsquo;s room, with the old mother alone in there, had a rather awful
      aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathalie Haldin murmured sadly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are wondering what my feelings are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Essentially that was true. It was that very wonder which unsettled my
      sympathy of a dense Occidental. I could get hold of nothing but of some
      commonplace phrases, those futile phrases that give the measure of our
      impotence before each other&rsquo;s trials I mumbled something to the effect
      that, for the young, life held its hopes and compensations. It held duties
      too&mdash;but of that I was certain it was not necessary to remind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a handkerchief in her hands and pulled at it nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not likely to forget my mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We used to be three. Now
      we are two&mdash;two women. She&rsquo;s not so very old. She may live quite a
      long time yet. What have we to look for in the future? For what hope and
      what consolation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take a wider view,&rdquo; I said resolutely, thinking that with this
      exceptional creature this was the right note to strike. She looked at me
      steadily for a moment, and then the tears she had been keeping down flowed
      unrestrained. She jumped up and stood in the window with her back to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slipped away without attempting even to approach her. Next day I was
      told at the door that Mrs. Haldin was better. The middle-aged servant
      remarked that a lot of people&mdash;Russians&mdash;had called that day,
      but Miss Haldin bad not seen anybody. A fortnight later, when making my
      daily call, I was asked in and found Mrs. Haldin sitting in her usual
      place by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first one would have thought that nothing was changed. I saw across the
      room the familiar profile, a little sharper in outline and overspread by a
      uniform pallor as might have been expected in an invalid. But no disease
      could have accounted for the change in her black eyes, smiling no longer
      with gentle irony. She raised them as she gave me her hand. I observed the
      three weeks&rsquo; old number of the <i>Standard</i> folded with the
      correspondence from Russia uppermost, lying on a little table by the side
      of the armchair. Mrs. Haldin&rsquo;s voice was startlingly weak and colourless.
      Her first words to me framed a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has there been anything more in papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I released her long emaciated hand, shook my head negatively, and sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The English press is wonderful. Nothing can be kept secret from it, and
      all the world must hear. Only our Russian news is not always easy to
      understand. Not always easy.... But English mothers do not look for news
      like that....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on the newspaper and took it away again. I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We too have had tragic times in our history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time ago. A very long time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are nations that have made their bargain with fate,&rdquo; said Miss
      Haldin, who had approached us. &ldquo;We need not envy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this scorn?&rdquo; I asked gently. &ldquo;It may be that our bargain was not a
      very lofty one. But the terms men and nations obtain from Fate are
      hallowed by the price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldin turned her head away and looked out of the window for a time,
      with that new, sombre, extinct gaze of her sunken eyes which so completely
      made another woman of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Englishman, this correspondent,&rdquo; she addressed me suddenly, &ldquo;do you
      think it is possible that he knew my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this strange question I could only say that it was possible of course.
      She saw my surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one knew what sort of man he was one could perhaps write to him,&rdquo; she
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother thinks,&rdquo; explained Miss Haldin, standing between us, with one hand
      resting on the back of my chair, &ldquo;that my poor brother perhaps did not try
      to save himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up at Miss Haldin in sympathetic consternation, but Miss Haldin
      was looking down calmly at her mother. The latter said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know the address of any of his friends. Indeed, we know nothing
      of his Petersburg comrades. He had a multitude of young friends, only he
      never spoke much of them. One could guess that they were his disciples and
      that they idolized him. But he was so modest. One would think that with so
      many devoted....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She averted her head again and looked down the Boulevard des Philosophes,
      a singularly arid and dusty thoroughfare, where nothing could be seen at
      the moment but two dogs, a little girl in a pinafore hopping on one leg,
      and in the distance a workman wheeling a bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even amongst the Apostles of Christ there was found a Judas,&rdquo; she
      whispered as if to herself, but with the evident intention to be heard by
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Russian visitors assembled in little knots, conversed amongst
      themselves meantime, in low murmurs, and with brief glances in our
      direction. It was a great contrast to the usual loud volubility of these
      gatherings. Miss Haldin followed me into the ante-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People will come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We cannot shut the door in their faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I was putting on my overcoat she began to talk to me of her mother.
      Poor Mrs. Haldin was fretting after more news. She wanted to go on hearing
      about her unfortunate son. She could not make up her mind to abandon him
      quietly to the dumb unknown. She would persist in pursuing him in there
      through the long days of motionless silence face to face with the empty
      Boulevard des Philosophes. She could not understand why he had not escaped&mdash;as
      so many other revolutionists and conspirators had managed to escape in
      other instances of that kind. It was really inconceivable that the means
      of secret revolutionary organisations should have failed so inexcusably to
      preserve her son. But in reality the inconceivable that staggered her mind
      was nothing but the cruel audacity of Death passing over her head to
      strike at that young and precious heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin mechanically, with an absorbed look, handed me my hat. I
      understood from her that the poor woman was possessed by the sombre and
      simple idea that her son must have perished because he did not want to be
      saved. It could not have been that he despaired of his country&rsquo;s future.
      That was impossible. Was it possible that his mother and sister had not
      known how to merit his confidence; and that, after having done what he was
      compelled to do, his spirit became crushed by an intolerable doubt, his
      mind distracted by a sudden mistrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very much shocked by this piece of ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our three lives were like that!&rdquo; Miss Haldin twined the fingers of both
      her hands together in demonstration, then separated them slowly, looking
      straight into my face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what poor mother found to torment herself
      and me with, for all the years to come,&rdquo; added the strange girl. At that
      moment her indefinable charm was revealed to me in the conjunction of
      passion and stoicism. I imagined what her life was likely to be by the
      side of Mrs. Haldin&rsquo;s terrible immobility, inhabited by that fixed idea.
      But my concern was reduced to silence by my ignorance of her modes of
      feeling. Difference of nationality is a terrible obstacle for our complex
      Western natures. But Miss Haldin probably was too simple to suspect my
      embarrassment. She did not wait for me to say anything, but as if reading
      my thoughts on my face she went on courageously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first poor mother went numb, as our peasants say; then she began to
      think and she will go on now thinking and thinking in that unfortunate
      strain. You see yourself how cruel that is....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never spoke with greater sincerity than when I agreed with her that it
      would be deplorable in the highest degree. She took an anxious breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all these strange details in the English paper,&rdquo; she exclaimed
      suddenly. &ldquo;What is the meaning of them? I suppose they are true? But is it
      not terrible that my poor brother should be caught wandering alone, as if
      in despair, about the streets at night....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stood so close to each other in the dark anteroom that I could see her
      biting her lower lip to suppress a dry sob. After a short pause she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggested to mother that he may have been betrayed by some false friend
      or simply by some cowardly creature. It may be easier for her to believe
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood now the poor woman&rsquo;s whispered allusion to Judas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be easier,&rdquo; I admitted, admiring inwardly the directness and the
      subtlety of the girl&rsquo;s outlook. She was dealing with life as it was made
      for her by the political conditions of her country. She faced cruel
      realities, not morbid imaginings of her own making. I could not defend
      myself from a certain feeling of respect when she added simply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time they say can soften every sort of bitterness. But I cannot believe
      that it has any power over remorse. It is better that mother should think
      some person guilty of Victor&rsquo;s death, than that she should connect it with
      a weakness of her son or a shortcoming of her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, yourself, don&rsquo;t suppose that....&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She compressed her lips and shook her head. She harboured no evil thoughts
      against any one, she declared&mdash;and perhaps nothing that happened was
      unnecessary. On these words, pronounced low and sounding mysterious in the
      half obscurity of the ante-room, we parted with an expressive and warm
      handshake. The grip of her strong, shapely hand had a seductive frankness,
      a sort of exquisite virility. I do not know why she should have felt so
      friendly to me. It may be that she thought I understood her much better
      than I was able to do. The most precise of her sayings seemed always to me
      to have enigmatical prolongations vanishing somewhere beyond my reach. I
      am reduced to suppose that she appreciated my attention and my silence.
      The attention she could see was quite sincere, so that the silence could
      not be suspected of coldness. It seemed to satisfy her. And it is to be
      noted that if she confided in me it was clearly not with the expectation
      of receiving advice, for which, indeed she never asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Our daily relations were interrupted at this period for something like a
      fortnight. I had to absent myself unexpectedly from Geneva. On my return I
      lost no time in directing my steps up the Boulevard des Philosophes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open door of the drawing-room I was annoyed to hear a visitor
      holding forth steadily in an unctuous deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldin&rsquo;s armchair by the window stood empty. On the sofa, Nathalie
      Haldin raised her charming grey eyes in a glance of greeting accompanied
      by the merest hint of a welcoming smile. But she made no movement. With
      her strong white hands lying inverted in the lap of her mourning dress she
      faced a man who presented to me a robust back covered with black
      broadcloth, and well in keeping with the deep voice. He turned his head
      sharply over his shoulder, but only for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! your English friend. I know. I know. That&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wore spectacles with smoked glasses, a tall silk hat stood on the floor
      by the side of his chair. Flourishing slightly a big soft hand he went on
      with his discourse, precipitating his delivery a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never changed the faith I held while wandering in the forests and
      bogs of Siberia. It sustained me then&mdash;it sustains me now. The great
      Powers of Europe are bound to disappear&mdash;and the cause of their
      collapse will be very simple. They will exhaust themselves struggling
      against their proletariat. In Russia it is different. In Russia we have no
      classes to combat each other, one holding the power of wealth, and the
      other mighty with the strength of numbers. We have only an unclean
      bureaucracy in the face of a people as great and as incorruptible as the
      ocean. No, we have no classes. But we have the Russian woman. The
      admirable Russian woman! I receive most remarkable letters signed by
      women. So elevated in tone, so courageous, breathing such a noble ardour
      of service! The greatest part of our hopes rests on women. I behold their
      thirst for knowledge. It is admirable. Look how they absorb, how they are
      making it their own. It is miraculous. But what is knowledge? ...I
      understand that you have not been studying anything especially&mdash;medicine
      for instance. No? That&rsquo;s right. Had I been honoured by being asked to
      advise you on the use of your time when you arrived here I would have been
      strongly opposed to such a course. Knowledge in itself is mere dross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had one of those bearded Russian faces without shape, a mere appearance
      of flesh and hair with not a single feature having any sort of character.
      His eyes being hidden by the dark glasses there was an utter absence of
      all expression. I knew him by sight. He was a Russian refugee of mark. All
      Geneva knew his burly black-coated figure. At one time all Europe was
      aware of the story of his life written by himself and translated into
      seven or more languages. In his youth he had led an idle, dissolute life.
      Then a society girl he was about to marry died suddenly and thereupon he
      abandoned the world of fashion, and began to conspire in a spirit of
      repentance, and, after that, his native autocracy took good care that the
      usual things should happen to him. He was imprisoned in fortresses, beaten
      within an inch of his life, and condemned to work in mines, with common
      criminals. The great success of his book, however, was the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not remember now the details of the weight and length of the fetters
      riveted on his limbs by an &ldquo;Administrative&rdquo; order, but it was in the
      number of pounds and the thickness of links an appalling assertion of the
      divine right of autocracy. Appalling and futile too, because this big man
      managed to carry off that simple engine of government with him into the
      woods. The sensational clink of these fetters is heard all through the
      chapters describing his escape&mdash;a subject of wonder to two
      continents. He had begun by concealing himself successfully from his guard
      in a hole on a river bank. It was the end of the day; with infinite labour
      he managed to free one of his legs. Meantime night fell. He was going to
      begin on his other leg when he was overtaken by a terrible misfortune. He
      dropped his file.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is precise yet symbolic; and the file had its pathetic history.
      It was given to him unexpectedly one evening, by a quiet, pale-faced girl.
      The poor creature had come out to the mines to join one of his fellow
      convicts, a delicate young man, a mechanic and a social democrat, with
      broad cheekbones and large staring eyes. She had worked her way across
      half Russia and nearly the whole of Siberia to be near him, and, as it
      seems, with the hope of helping him to escape. But she arrived too late.
      Her lover had died only a week before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through that obscure episode, as he says, in the history of ideas in
      Russia, the file came into his hands, and inspired him with an ardent
      resolution to regain his liberty. When it slipped through his fingers it
      was as if it had gone straight into the earth. He could by no manner of
      means put his hand on it again in the dark. He groped systematically in
      the loose earth, in the mud, in the water; the night was passing meantime,
      the precious night on which he counted to get away into the forests, his
      only chance of escape. For a moment he was tempted by despair to give up;
      but recalling the quiet, sad face of the heroic girl, he felt profoundly
      ashamed of his weakness. She had selected him for the gift of liberty and
      he must show himself worthy of the favour conferred by her feminine,
      indomitable soul. It appeared to be a sacred trust. To fail would have
      been a sort of treason against the sacredness of self-sacrifice and
      womanly love.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are in his book whole pages of self-analysis whence emerges like a
      white figure from a dark confused sea the conviction of woman&rsquo;s spiritual
      superiority&mdash;his new faith confessed since in several volumes. His
      first tribute to it, the great act of his conversion, was his
      extraordinary existence in the endless forests of the Okhotsk Province,
      with the loose end of the chain wound about his waist. A strip torn off
      his convict shirt secured the end firmly. Other strips fastened it at
      intervals up his left leg to deaden the clanking and to prevent the slack
      links from getting hooked in the bushes. He became very fierce. He
      developed an unsuspected genius for the arts of a wild and hunted
      existence. He learned to creep into villages without betraying his
      presence by anything more than an occasional faint jingle. He broke into
      outhouses with an axe he managed to purloin in a wood-cutters&rsquo; camp. In
      the deserted tracts of country he lived on wild berries and hunted for
      honey. His clothing dropped off him gradually. His naked tawny figure
      glimpsed vaguely through the bushes with a cloud of mosquitoes and flies
      hovering about the shaggy head, spread tales of terror through whole
      districts. His temper grew savage as the days went by, and he was glad to
      discover that that there was so much of a brute in him. He had nothing
      else to put his trust in. For it was as though there had been two human
      beings indissolubly joined in that enterprise. The civilized man, the
      enthusiast of advanced humanitarian ideals thirsting for the triumph of
      spiritual love and political liberty; and the stealthy, primeval savage,
      pitilessly cunning in the preservation of his freedom from day to day,
      like a tracked wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild beast was making its way instinctively eastward to the Pacific
      coast, and the civilised humanitarian in fearful anxious dependence
      watched the proceedings with awe. Through all these weeks he could never
      make up his mind to appeal to human compassion. In the wary primeval
      savage this shyness might have been natural, but the other too, the
      civilized creature, the thinker, the escaping &ldquo;political&rdquo; had developed an
      absurd form of morbid pessimism, a form of temporary insanity, originating
      perhaps in the physical worry and discomfort of the chain. These links, he
      fancied, made him odious to the rest of mankind. It was a repugnant and
      suggestive load. Nobody could feel any pity at the disgusting sight of a
      man escaping with a broken chain. His imagination became affected by his
      fetters in a precise, matter-of-fact manner. It seemed to him impossible
      that people could resist the temptation of fastening the loose end to a
      staple in the wall while they went for the nearest police official.
      Crouching in holes or hidden in thickets, he had tried to read the faces
      of unsuspecting free settlers working in the clearings or passing along
      the paths within a foot or two of his eyes. His feeling was that no man on
      earth could be trusted with the temptation of the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, he chanced to come upon a solitary woman. It was on an
      open slope of rough grass outside the forest. She sat on the bank of a
      narrow stream; she had a red handkerchief on her head and a small basket
      was lying on the ground near her hand. At a little distance could be seen
      a cluster of log cabins, with a water-mill over a dammed pool shaded by
      birch trees and looking bright as glass in the twilight. He approached her
      silently, his hatchet stuck in his iron belt, a thick cudgel in his hand;
      there were leaves and bits of twig in his tangled hair, in his matted
      beard; bunches of rags he had wound round the links fluttered from his
      waist. A faint clink of his fetters made the woman turn her head. Too
      terrified by this savage apparition to jump up or even to scream, she was
      yet too stout-hearted to faint.... Expecting nothing less than to be
      murdered on the spot she covered her eyes with her hands to avoid the
      sight of the descending axe. When at last she found courage to look again,
      she saw the shaggy wild man sitting on the bank six feet away from her.
      His thin, sinewy arms hugged his naked legs; the long beard covered the
      knees on which he rested his chin; all these clasped, folded limbs, the
      bare shoulders, the wild head with red staring eyes, shook and trembled
      violently while the bestial creature was making efforts to speak. It was
      six weeks since he had heard the sound of his own voice. It seemed as
      though he had lost the faculty of speech. He had become a dumb and
      despairing brute, till the woman&rsquo;s sudden, unexpected cry of profound
      pity, the insight of her feminine compassion discovering the complex
      misery of the man under the terrifying aspect of the monster, restored him
      to the ranks of humanity. This point of view is presented in his book,
      with a very effective eloquence. She ended, he says, by shedding tears
      over him, sacred, redeeming tears, while he also wept with joy in the
      manner of a converted sinner. Directing him to hide in the bushes and wait
      patiently (a police patrol was expected in the Settlement) she went away
      towards the houses, promising to return at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if providentially appointed to be the newly wedded wife of the village
      blacksmith, the woman persuaded her husband to come out with her, bringing
      some tools of his trade, a hammer, a chisel, a small anvil.... &ldquo;My
      fetters&rdquo;&mdash;the book says&mdash;&ldquo;were struck off on the banks of the
      stream, in the starlight of a calm night by an athletic, taciturn young
      man of the people, kneeling at my feet, while the woman like a liberating
      genius stood by with clasped hands.&rdquo; Obviously a symbolic couple. At the
      same time they furnished his regained humanity with some decent clothing,
      and put heart into the new man by the information that the seacoast of the
      Pacific was only a very few miles away. It could be seen, in fact, from
      the top of the next ridge....
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of his escape does not lend itself to mystic treatment and
      symbolic interpretation. He ended by finding his way to the West by the
      Suez Canal route in the usual manner. Reaching the shores of South Europe
      he sat down to write his autobiography&mdash;the great literary success of
      its year. This book was followed by other books written with the declared
      purpose of elevating humanity. In these works he preached generally the
      cult of the woman. For his own part he practised it under the rites of
      special devotion to the transcendental merits of a certain Madame de S&mdash;,
      a lady of advanced views, no longer very young, once upon a time the
      intriguing wife of a now dead and forgotten diplomat. Her loud pretensions
      to be one of the leaders of modern thought and of modern sentiment, she
      sheltered (like Voltaire and Mme. de Stael) on the republican territory of
      Geneva. Driving through the streets in her big landau she exhibited to the
      indifference of the natives and the stares of the tourists a long-waisted,
      youthful figure of hieratic stiffness, with a pair of big gleaming eyes,
      rolling restlessly behind a short veil of black lace, which, coming down
      no further than her vividly red lips, resembled a mask. Usually the
      &ldquo;heroic fugitive&rdquo; (this name was bestowed upon him in a review of the
      English edition of his book)&mdash;the &ldquo;heroic fugitive&rdquo; accompanied her,
      sitting, portentously bearded and darkly bespectacled, not by her side,
      but opposite her, with his back to the horses. Thus, facing each other,
      with no one else in the roomy carriage, their airings suggested a
      conscious public manifestation. Or it may have been unconscious. Russian
      simplicity often marches innocently on the edge of cynicism for some lofty
      purpose. But it is a vain enterprise for sophisticated Europe to try and
      understand these doings. Considering the air of gravity extending even to
      the physiognomy of the coachman and the action of the showy horses, this
      quaint display might have possessed a mystic significance, but to the
      corrupt frivolity of a Western mind, like my own, it seemed hardly decent.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it is not becoming for an obscure teacher of languages to
      criticize a &ldquo;heroic fugitive&rdquo; of worldwide celebrity. I was aware from
      hearsay that he was an industrious busy-body, hunting up his compatriots
      in hotels, in private lodgings, and&mdash;I was told&mdash;conferring upon
      them the honour of his notice in public gardens when a suitable opening
      presented itself. I was under the impression that after a visit or two,
      several months before, he had given up the ladies Haldin&mdash;no doubt
      reluctantly, for there could be no question of his being a determined
      person. It was perhaps to be expected that he should reappear again on
      this terrible occasion, as a Russian and a revolutionist, to say the right
      thing, to strike the true, perhaps a comforting, note. But I did not like
      to see him sitting there. I trust that an unbecoming jealousy of my
      privileged position had nothing to do with it. I made no claim to a
      special standing for my silent friendship. Removed by the difference of
      age and nationality as if into the sphere of another existence, I
      produced, even upon myself, the effect of a dumb helpless ghost, of an
      anxious immaterial thing that could only hover about without the power to
      protect or guide by as much as a whisper. Since Miss Haldin with her sure
      instinct had refrained from introducing me to the burly celebrity, I would
      have retired quietly and returned later on, had I not met a peculiar
      expression in her eyes which I interpreted as a request to stay, with the
      view, perhaps, of shortening an unwelcome visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his hat, but only to deposit it on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall meet again, Natalia Victorovna. To-day I have called only to
      mark those feelings towards your honoured mother and yourself, the nature
      of which you cannot doubt. I needed no urging, but Eleanor&mdash;Madame de
      S&mdash; herself has in a way sent me. She extends to you the hand of
      feminine fellowship. There is positively in all the range of human
      sentiments no joy and no sorrow that woman cannot understand, elevate, and
      spiritualize by her interpretation. That young man newly arrived from St.
      Petersburg, I have mentioned to you, is already under the charm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Miss Haldin got up abruptly. I was glad. He did not
      evidently expect anything so decisive and, at first, throwing his head
      back, he tilted up his dark glasses with bland curiosity. At last,
      recollecting himself, he stood up hastily, seizing his hat off his knees
      with great adroitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it, Natalia Victorovna, that you have kept aloof so long, from
      what after all is&mdash;let disparaging tongues say what they like&mdash;a
      unique centre of intellectual freedom and of effort to shape a high
      conception of our future? In the case of your honoured mother I understand
      in a measure. At her age new ideas&mdash;new faces are not perhaps.... But
      you! Was it mistrust&mdash;or indifference? You must come out of your
      reserve. We Russians have no right to be reserved with each other. In our
      circumstances it is almost a crime against humanity. The luxury of private
      grief is not for us. Nowadays the devil is not combated by prayers and
      fasting. And what is fasting after all but starvation. You must not starve
      yourself, Natalia Victorovna. Strength is what we want. Spiritual
      strength, I mean. As to the other kind, what could withstand us Russians
      if we only put it forth? Sin is different in our day, and the way of
      salvation for pure souls is different too. It is no longer to be found in
      monasteries but in the world, in the...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deep sound seemed to rise from under the floor, and one felt steeped
      in it to the lips. Miss Haldin&rsquo;s interruption resembled the effort of a
      drowning person to keep above water. She struck in with an accent of
      impatience&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Peter Ivanovitch, I don&rsquo;t mean to retire into a monastery. Who would
      look for salvation there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke figuratively,&rdquo; he boomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I am speaking figuratively too. But sorrow is sorrow and pain
      is pain in the old way. They make their demands upon people. One has got
      to face them the best way one can. I know that the blow which has fallen
      upon us so unexpectedly is only an episode in the fate of a people. You
      may rest assured that I don&rsquo;t forget that. But just now I have to think of
      my mother. How can you expect me to leave her to herself...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is putting it in a very crude way,&rdquo; he protested in his great
      effortless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin did not wait for the vibration to die out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And run about visiting amongst a lot of strange people. The idea is
      distasteful for me; and I do not know what else you may mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He towered before her, enormous, deferential, cropped as close as a
      convict and this big pinkish poll evoked for me the vision of a wild head
      with matted locks peering through parted bushes, glimpses of naked, tawny
      limbs slinking behind the masses of sodden foliage under a cloud of flies
      and mosquitoes. It was an involuntary tribute to the vigour of his
      writing. Nobody could doubt that he had wandered in Siberian forests,
      naked and girt with a chain. The black broadcloth coat invested his person
      with a character of austere decency&mdash;something recalling a
      missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I want, Natalia Victorovna?&rdquo; he uttered solemnly. &ldquo;I
      want you to be a fanatic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fanatic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Faith alone won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice dropped to a still lower tone. He raised for a moment one thick
      arm; the other remained hanging down against his thigh, with the fragile
      silk hat at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell you now something which I entreat you to ponder over
      carefully. Listen, we need a force that would move heaven and earth&mdash;nothing
      less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The profound, subterranean note of this &ldquo;nothing less&rdquo; made one shudder,
      almost, like the deep muttering of wind in the pipes of an organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are we to find that force in the salon of Madame de S&mdash;? Excuse
      me, Peter Ivanovitch, if I permit myself to doubt it. Is not that lady a
      woman of the great world, an aristocrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prejudice!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You astonish me. And suppose she was all that! She
      is also a woman of flesh and blood. There is always something to weigh
      down the spiritual side in all of us. But to make of it a reproach is what
      I did not expect from you. No! I did not expect that. One would think you
      have listened to some malevolent scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard no gossip, I assure you. In our province how could we? But
      the world speaks of her. What can there be in common in a lady of that
      sort and an obscure country girl like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a perpetual manifestation of a noble and peerless spirit,&rdquo; he
      broke in. &ldquo;Her charm&mdash;no, I shall not speak of her charm. But, of
      course, everybody who approaches her falls under the spell....
      Contradictions vanish, trouble falls away from one.... Unless I am
      mistaken&mdash;but I never make a mistake in spiritual matters&mdash;you
      are troubled in your soul, Natalia Victorovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin&rsquo;s clear eyes looked straight at his soft enormous face; I
      received the impression that behind these dark spectacles of his he could
      be as impudent as he chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the other evening walking back to town from Chateau Borel with our
      latest interesting arrival from Petersburg, I could notice the powerful
      soothing influence&mdash;I may say reconciling influence.... There he was,
      all these kilometres along the shores of the lake, silent, like a man who
      has been shown the way of peace. I could feel the leaven working in his
      soul, you understand. For one thing he listened to me patiently. I myself
      was inspired that evening by the firm and exquisite genius of Eleanor&mdash;Madame
      de S&mdash;, you know. It was a full moon and I could observe his face. I
      cannot be deceived....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin, looking down, seemed to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I will think of what you said, Peter Ivanovitch. I shall try to
      call as soon as I can leave mother for an hour or two safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coldly as these words were said I was amazed at the concession. He
      snatched her right hand with such fervour that I thought he was going to
      press it to his lips or his breast. But he only held it by the finger-tips
      in his great paw and shook it a little up and down while he delivered his
      last volley of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s right. I haven&rsquo;t obtained your full confidence as
      yet, Natalia Victorovna, but that will come. All in good time. The sister
      of Viktor Haldin cannot be without importance.... It&rsquo;s simply impossible.
      And no woman can remain sitting on the steps. Flowers, tears, applause&mdash;that
      has had its time; it&rsquo;s a mediaeval conception. The arena, the arena itself
      is the place for women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He relinquished her hand with a flourish, as if giving it to her for a
      gift, and remained still, his head bowed in dignified submission before
      her femininity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The arena!... You must descend into the arena, Natalia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made one step backwards, inclined his enormous body, and was gone
      swiftly. The door fell to behind him. But immediately the powerful
      resonance of his voice was heard addressing in the ante-room the
      middle-aged servant woman who was letting him out. Whether he exhorted her
      too to descend into the arena I cannot tell. The thing sounded like a
      lecture, and the slight crash of the outer door cut it short suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We remained looking at each other for a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know who he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin, coming forward, put this question to me in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took her offered hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody knows. He is a revolutionary feminist, a great writer, if you
      like, and&mdash;how shall I say it&mdash;the&mdash;the familiar guest of
      Madame de S&mdash;&lsquo;s mystic revolutionary salon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin passed her hand over her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, he was with me for more than an hour before you came in. I was
      so glad mother was lying down. She has many nights without sleep, and then
      sometimes in the middle of the day she gets a rest of several hours. It is
      sheer exhaustion&mdash;but still, I am thankful.... If it were not for
      these intervals....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me and, with that extraordinary penetration which used to
      disconcert me, shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She would not go mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; I cried, by way of protest, the more shocked because
      in my heart I was far from thinking Mrs. Haldin quite sane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a fine, lucid intellect mother had,&rdquo; continued
      Nathalie Haldin, with her calm, clear-eyed simplicity, which seemed to me
      always to have a quality of heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure....&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I darkened mother&rsquo;s room and came out here. I&rsquo;ve wanted for so long to
      think quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, then, without giving any sign of distress, added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so
      difficult,&rdquo; and looked at me with a strange fixity, as if watching for a
      sign of dissent or surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave neither. I was irresistibly impelled to say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The visit from that gentleman has not made it any easier, I fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin stood before me with a peculiar expression in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand completely. Some guide one must have, even
      if one does not wholly give up the direction of one&rsquo;s conduct to him. I am
      an inexperienced girl, but I am not slavish, There has been too much of
      that in Russia. Why should I not listen to him? There is no harm in having
      one&rsquo;s thoughts directed. But I don&rsquo;t mind confessing to you that I have
      not been completely candid with Peter Ivanovitch. I don&rsquo;t quite know what
      prevented me at the moment....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked away suddenly from me to a distant part of the room; but it was
      only to open and shut a drawer in a bureau. She returned with a piece of
      paper in her hand. It was thin and blackened with close handwriting. It
      was obviously a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to read you the very words,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is one of my poor
      brother&rsquo;s letters. He never doubted. How could he doubt? They make only
      such a small handful, these miserable oppressors, before the unanimous
      will of our people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother believed in the power of a people&rsquo;s will to achieve
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was his religion,&rdquo; declared Miss Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her calm face and her animated eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the will must be awakened, inspired, concentrated,&rdquo; she went
      on. &ldquo;That is the true task of real agitators. One has got to give up one&rsquo;s
      life to it. The degradation of servitude, the absolutist lies must be
      uprooted and swept out. Reform is impossible. There is nothing to reform.
      There is no legality, there are no institutions. There are only arbitrary
      decrees. There is only a handful of cruel&mdash;perhaps blind&mdash;officials
      against a nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter rustled slightly in her hand. I glanced down at the flimsy
      blackened pages whose very handwriting seemed cabalistic, incomprehensible
      to the experience of Western Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stated like this,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;the problem seems simple enough. But I
      fear I shall not see it solved. And if you go back to Russia I know that I
      shall not see you again. Yet once more I say: go back! Don&rsquo;t suppose that
      I am thinking of your preservation. No! I know that you will not be
      returning to personal safety. But I had much rather think of you in danger
      there than see you exposed to what may be met here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin, after a moment of reflection. &ldquo;I
      believe that you hate revolution; you fancy it&rsquo;s not quite honest. You
      belong to a people which has made a bargain with fate and wouldn&rsquo;t like to
      be rude to it. But we have made no bargain. It was never offered to us&mdash;so
      much liberty for so much hard cash. You shrink from the idea of
      revolutionary action for those you think well of as if it were something&mdash;how
      shall I say it&mdash;not quite decent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I think very highly of you&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose I do not know it,&rdquo; she began hurriedly. &ldquo;Your friendship
      has been very valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done little else but look on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was a little flushed under the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a way of looking on which is valuable I have felt less lonely
      because of it. It&rsquo;s difficult to explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Well, I too have felt less lonely. That&rsquo;s easy to explain,
      though. But it won&rsquo;t go on much longer. The last thing I want to tell you
      is this: in a real revolution&mdash;not a simple dynastic change or a mere
      reform of institutions&mdash;in a real revolution the best characters do
      not come to the front. A violent revolution falls into the hands of
      narrow-minded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at first. Afterwards
      comes the turn of all the pretentious intellectual failures of the time.
      Such are the chiefs and the leaders. You will notice that I have left out
      the mere rogues. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane, and
      devoted natures; the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement&mdash;but
      it passes away from them. They are not the leaders of a revolution. They
      are its victims: the victims of disgust, of disenchantment&mdash;often of
      remorse. Hopes grotesquely betrayed, ideals caricatured&mdash;that is the
      definition of revolutionary success. There have been in every revolution
      hearts broken by such successes. But enough of that. My meaning is that I
      don&rsquo;t want you to be a victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could believe all you have said I still wouldn&rsquo;t think of myself,&rdquo;
       protested Miss Haldin. &ldquo;I would take liberty from any hand as a hungry man
      would snatch at a piece of bread. The true progress must begin after. And
      for that the right men shall be found. They are already amongst us. One
      comes upon them in their obscurity, unknown, preparing themselves....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spread out the letter she had kept in her hand all the time, and
      looking down at it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! One comes upon such men!&rdquo; she repeated, and then read out the words,
      &ldquo;Unstained, lofty, and solitary existences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Folding up the letter, while I looked at her interrogatively, she
      explained&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the words which my brother applies to a young man he came to
      know in St. Petersburg. An intimate friend, I suppose. It must be. His is
      the only name my brother mentions in all his correspondence with me.
      Absolutely the only one, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;the man is
      here. He arrived recently in Geneva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;But, of course; you must have seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! I haven&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t know he was here. It&rsquo;s Peter Ivanovitch
      himself who told me. You have heard him yourself mentioning a new arrival
      from Petersburg.... Well, that is the man of &lsquo;unstained, lofty, and
      solitary existence.&rsquo; My brother&rsquo;s friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compromised politically, I suppose,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Yes. It must be so. Who knows! Perhaps it was this very
      friendship with my brother which.... But no! It is scarcely possible.
      Really, I know nothing except what Peter Ivanovitch told me of him. He has
      brought a letter of introduction from Father Zosim&mdash;you know, the
      priest-democrat; you have heard of Father Zosim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. The famous Father Zosim was staying here in Geneva for some two
      months about a year ago,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;When he left here he seems to have
      disappeared from the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears that he is at work in Russia again. Somewhere in the centre,&rdquo;
       Miss Haldin said, with animation. &ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t mention that to any
      one&mdash;don&rsquo;t let it slip from you, because if it got into the papers it
      would be dangerous for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are anxious, of course, to meet that friend of your brother?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin put the letter into her pocket. Her eyes looked beyond my
      shoulder at the door of her mother&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Not for the first time, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of silence I said good-bye, but Miss Haldin followed me
      into the ante-room, closing the door behind us carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you guess where I mean to go tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made up your mind to call on Madame de S&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am going to the Chateau Borel. I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect to hear there?&rdquo; I asked, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if she were not deluding herself with some impossible hope. It
      was not that, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only think&mdash;such a friend. The only man mentioned in his letters. He
      would have something to give me, if nothing more than a few poor words. It
      may be something said and thought in those last days. Would you want me to
      turn my back on what is left of my poor brother&mdash;a friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I quite understand your pious curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Unstained, lofty, and solitary existences,&rdquo; she murmured to
      herself. &ldquo;There are! There are! Well, let me question one of them about
      the loved dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know, though, that you will meet him there? Is he staying in
      the Chateau as a guest&mdash;do you suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really tell,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;He brought a written introduction
      from Father Zosim&mdash;who, it seems, is a friend of Madame de S&mdash;
      too. She can&rsquo;t be such a worthless woman after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were all sorts of rumours afloat about Father Zosim himself,&rdquo; I
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calumny is a weapon of our government too. It&rsquo;s well known. Oh yes! It is
      a fact that Father Zosim had the protection of the Governor-General of a
      certain province. We talked on the subject with my brother two years ago,
      I remember. But his work was good. And now he is proscribed. What better
      proof can one require. But no matter what that priest was or is. All that
      cannot affect my brother&rsquo;s friend. If I don&rsquo;t meet him there I shall ask
      these people for his address. And, of course, mother must see him too,
      later on. There is no guessing what he may have to tell us. It would be a
      mercy if mamma could be soothed. You know what she imagines. Some
      explanation perhaps may be found, or&mdash;or even made up, perhaps. It
      would be no sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it would be no sin. It may be a mistake, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want her only to recover some of her old spirit. While she is like this
      I cannot think of anything calmly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to invent some sort of pious fraud for your mother&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why fraud? Such a friend is sure to know something of my brother in these
      last days. He could tell us.... There is something in the facts which will
      not let me rest. I am certain he meant to join us abroad&mdash;that he had
      some plans&mdash;some great patriotic action in view; not only for
      himself, but for both of us. I trusted in that. I looked forward to the
      time! Oh! with such hope and impatience. I could have helped. And now
      suddenly this appearance of recklessness&mdash;as if he had not cared....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent for a time, then obstinately she concluded&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thinking it over, later on, while I walked slowly away from the Boulevard
      des Philosophes, I asked myself critically, what precisely was it that she
      wanted to know? What I had heard of her history was enough to give me a
      clue. In the educational establishment for girls where Miss Haldin
      finished her studies she was looked upon rather unfavourably. She was
      suspected of holding independent views on matters settled by official
      teaching. Afterwards, when the two ladies returned to their country place,
      both mother and daughter, by speaking their minds openly on public events,
      had earned for themselves a reputation of liberalism. The three-horse trap
      of the district police-captain began to be seen frequently in their
      village. &ldquo;I must keep an eye on the peasants&rdquo;&mdash;so he explained his
      visits up at the house. &ldquo;Two lonely ladies must be looked after a little.&rdquo;
       He would inspect the walls as though he wanted to pierce them with his
      eyes, peer at the photographs, turn over the books in the drawing-room
      negligently, and after the usual refreshments, would depart. But the old
      priest of the village came one evening in the greatest distress and
      agitation, to confess that he&mdash;the priest&mdash;had been ordered to
      watch and ascertain in other ways too (such as using his spiritual power
      with the servants) all that was going on in the house, and especially in
      respect of the visitors these ladies received, who they were, the length
      of their stay, whether any of them were strangers to that part of the
      country, and so on. The poor, simple old man was in an agony of
      humiliation and terror. &ldquo;I came to warn you. Be cautious in your conduct,
      for the love of God. I am burning with shame, but there is no getting out
      from under the net. I shall have to tell them what I see, because if I did
      not there is my deacon. He would make the worst of things to curry favour.
      And then my son-in-law, the husband of my Parasha, who is a writer in the
      Government Domain office; they would soon kick him out&mdash;and maybe
      send him away somewhere.&rdquo; The old man lamented the necessities of the
      times&mdash;&ldquo;when people do not agree somehow&rdquo; and wiped his eyes. He did
      not wish to spend the evening of his days with a shaven head in the
      penitent&rsquo;s cell of some monastery&mdash;&ldquo;and subjected to all the
      severities of ecclesiastical discipline; for they would show no mercy to
      an old man,&rdquo; he groaned. He became almost hysterical, and the two ladies,
      full of commiseration, soothed him the best they could before they let him
      go back to his cottage. But, as a matter of fact, they had very few
      visitors. The neighbours&mdash;some of them old friends&mdash;began to
      keep away; a few from timidity, others with marked disdain, being grand
      people that came only for the summer&mdash;Miss Haldin explained to me&mdash;aristocrats,
      reactionaries. It was a solitary existence for a young girl. Her relations
      with her mother were of the tenderest and most open kind; but Mrs. Haldin
      had seen the experiences of her own generation, its sufferings, its
      deceptions, its apostasies too. Her affection for her children was
      expressed by the suppression of all signs of anxiety. She maintained a
      heroic reserve. To Nathalie Haldin, her brother with his Petersburg
      existence, not enigmatical in the least (there could be no doubt of what
      he felt or thought) but conducted a little mysteriously, was the only
      visible representative of a proscribed liberty. All the significance of
      freedom, its indefinite promises, lived in their long discussions, which
      breathed the loftiest hope of action and faith in success. Then, suddenly,
      the action, the hopes, came to an end with the details ferreted out by the
      English journalist. The concrete fact, the fact of his death remained! but
      it remained obscure in its deeper causes. She felt herself abandoned
      without explanation. But she did not suspect him. What she wanted was to
      learn almost at any cost how she could remain faithful to his departed
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days elapsed before I met Nathalie Haldin again. I was crossing
      the place in front of the theatre when I made out her shapely figure in
      the very act of turning between the gate pillars of the unattractive
      public promenade of the Bastions. She walked away from me, but I knew we
      should meet as she returned down the main alley&mdash;unless, indeed, she
      were going home. In that case, I don&rsquo;t think I should have called on her
      yet. My desire to keep her away from these people was as strong as ever,
      but I had no illusions as to my power. I was but a Westerner, and it was
      clear that Miss Haldin would not, could not listen to my wisdom; and as to
      my desire of listening to her voice, it were better, I thought, not to
      indulge overmuch in that pleasure. No, I should not have gone to the
      Boulevard des Philosophes; but when at about the middle of the principal
      alley I saw Miss Haldin coming towards me, I was too curious, and too
      honest, perhaps, to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something of the spring harshness in the air. The blue sky was
      hard, but the young leaves clung like soft mist about the uninteresting
      range of trees; and the clear sun put little points of gold into the grey
      of Miss Haldin&rsquo;s frank eyes, turned to me with a friendly greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired after the health of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a slight movement of the shoulders and a little sad sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you see, I did come out for a walk...for exercise, as you English
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled approvingly, and she added an unexpected remark&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a glorious day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, slightly harsh, but fascinating with its masculine and
      bird-like quality, had the accent of spontaneous conviction. I was glad of
      it. It was as though she had become aware of her youth&mdash;for there was
      but little of spring-like glory in the rectangular railed space of grass
      and trees, framed visibly by the orderly roof-slopes of that town, comely
      without grace, and hospitable without sympathy. In the very air through
      which she moved there was but little warmth; and the sky, the sky of a
      land without horizons, swept and washed clean by the April showers,
      extended a cold cruel blue, without elevation, narrowed suddenly by the
      ugly, dark wall of the Jura where, here and there, lingered yet a few
      miserable trails and patches of snow. All the glory of the season must
      have been within herself&mdash;and I was glad this feeling had come into
      her life, if only for a little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased to hear you say these words.&rdquo; She gave me a quick look.
      Quick, not stealthy. If there was one thing of which she was absolutely
      incapable, it was stealthiness, Her sincerity was expressed in the very
      rhythm of her walk. It was I who was looking at her covertly&mdash;if I
      may say so. I knew where she had been, but I did not know what she had
      seen and heard in that nest of aristocratic conspiracies. I use the word
      aristocratic, for want of a better term. The Chateau Borel, embowered in
      the trees and thickets of its neglected grounds, had its fame in our day,
      like the residence of that other dangerous and exiled woman, Madame de
      Stael, in the Napoleonic era. Only the Napoleonic despotism, the booted
      heir of the Revolution, which counted that intellectual woman for an enemy
      worthy to be watched, was something quite unlike the autocracy in mystic
      vestments, engendered by the slavery of a Tartar conquest. And Madame de S&mdash;
      was very far from resembling the gifted author of <i>Corinne</i>. She made
      a great noise about being persecuted. I don&rsquo;t know if she were regarded in
      certain circles as dangerous. As to being watched, I imagine that the
      Chateau Borel could be subjected only to a most distant observation. It
      was in its exclusiveness an ideal abode for hatching superior plots&mdash;whether
      serious or futile. But all this did not interest me. I wanted to know the
      effect its extraordinary inhabitants and its special atmosphere had
      produced on a girl like Miss Haldin, so true, so honest, but so
      dangerously inexperienced! Her unconsciously lofty ignorance of the baser
      instincts of mankind left her disarmed before her own impulses. And there
      was also that friend of her brother, the significant new arrival from
      Russia.... I wondered whether she had managed to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked for some time, slowly and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; I attacked her suddenly, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t intend telling me
      anything, you must say so distinctly, and then, of course, it shall be
      final. But I won&rsquo;t play at delicacy. I ask you point-blank for all the
      details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly at my threatening tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as curious as a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am only an anxious old man,&rdquo; I replied earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rested her glance on me as if to ascertain the degree of my anxiety or
      the number of my years. My physiognomy has never been expressive, I
      believe, and as to my years I am not ancient enough as yet to be
      strikingly decrepit. I have no long beard like the good hermit of a
      romantic ballad; my footsteps are not tottering, my aspect not that of a
      slow, venerable sage. Those picturesque advantages are not mine. I am old,
      alas, in a brisk, commonplace way. And it seemed to me as though there
      were some pity for me in Miss Haldin&rsquo;s prolonged glance. She stepped out a
      little quicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask for all the details. Let me see. I ought to remember them. It was
      novel enough for a&mdash;a village girl like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of silence she began by saying that the Chateau Borel was
      almost as neglected inside as outside. It was nothing to wonder at, a
      Hamburg banker, I believe, retired from business, had it built to cheer
      his remaining days by the view of that lake whose precise, orderly, and
      well-to-do beauty must have been attractive to the unromantic imagination
      of a business man. But he died soon. His wife departed too (but only to
      Italy), and this house of moneyed ease, presumably unsaleable, had stood
      empty for several years. One went to it up a gravel drive, round a large,
      coarse grass-plot, with plenty of time to observe the degradation of its
      stuccoed front. Miss Haldin said that the impression was unpleasant. It
      grew more depressing as one came nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She observed green stains of moss on the steps of the terrace. The front
      door stood wide open. There was no one about. She found herself in a wide,
      lofty, and absolutely empty hall, with a good many doors. These doors were
      all shut. A broad, bare stone staircase faced her, and the effect of the
      whole was of an untenanted house. She stood still, disconcerted by the
      solitude, but after a while she became aware of a voice speaking
      continuously somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were probably being observed all the time,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;There must
      have been eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that could be,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen even a bird
      in the grounds. I don&rsquo;t remember hearing a single twitter in the trees.
      The whole place appeared utterly deserted except for the voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not make out the language&mdash;Russian, French, or German. No
      one seemed to answer it. It was as though the voice had been left behind
      by the departed inhabitants to talk to the bare walls. It went on volubly,
      with a pause now and then. It was lonely and sad. The time seemed very
      long to Miss Haldin. An invincible repugnance prevented her from opening
      one of the doors in the hall. It was so hopeless. No one would come, the
      voice would never stop. She confessed to me that she had to resist an
      impulse to turn round and go away unseen, as she had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? You had that impulse?&rdquo; I cried, full of regret. &ldquo;What a pity you
      did not obey it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a strange memory it would have been for one. Those deserted grounds,
      that empty hall, that impersonal, voluble voice, and&mdash;nobody,
      nothing, not a soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The memory would have been unique and harmless. But she was not a girl to
      run away from an intimidating impression of solitude and mystery. &ldquo;No, I
      did not run away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I stayed where I was&mdash;and I did see a
      soul. Such a strange soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she was gazing up the broad staircase, and had concluded that the voice
      came from somewhere above, a rustle of dress attracted her attention. She
      looked down and saw a woman crossing the hall, having issued apparently
      through one of the many doors. Her face was averted, so that at first she
      was not aware of Miss Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      On turning her head and seeing a stranger, she appeared very much
      startled. From her slender figure Miss Haldin had taken her for a young
      girl; but if her face was almost childishly round, it was also sallow and
      wrinkled, with dark rings under the eyes. A thick crop of dusty brown hair
      was parted boyishly on the side with a lateral wave above the dry,
      furrowed forehead. After a moment of dumb blinking, she suddenly squatted
      down on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by squatted down?&rdquo; I asked, astonished. &ldquo;This is a very
      strange detail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin explained the reason. This person when first seen was carrying
      a small bowl in her hand. She had squatted down to put it on the floor for
      the benefit of a large cat, which appeared then from behind her skirts,
      and hid its head into the bowl greedily. She got up, and approaching Miss
      Haldin asked with nervous bluntness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want? Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin mentioned her name and also the name of Peter Ivanovitch. The
      girlish, elderly woman nodded and puckered her face into a momentary
      expression of sympathy. Her black silk blouse was old and even frayed in
      places; the black serge skirt was short and shabby. She continued to blink
      at close quarters, and her eyelashes and eyebrows seemed shabby too. Miss
      Haldin, speaking gently to her, as if to an unhappy and sensitive person,
      explained how it was that her visit could not be an altogether unexpected
      event to Madame de S&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Peter Ivanovitch brought you an invitation. How was I to know? A <i>dame
      de compangnie</i> is not consulted, as you may imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shabby woman laughed a little. Her teeth, splendidly white and
      admirably even, looked absurdly out of place, like a string of pearls on
      the neck of a ragged tramp. &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch is the greatest genius of
      the century perhaps, but he is the most inconsiderate man living. So if
      you have an appointment with him you must not be surprised to hear that he
      is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin explained that she had no appointment with Peter Ivanovitch.
      She became interested at once in that bizarre person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he put himself out for you or any one else? Oh! these
      geniuses. If you only knew! Yes! And their books&mdash;I mean, of course,
      the books that the world admires, the inspired books. But you have not
      been behind the scenes. Wait till you have to sit at a table for a half a
      day with a pen in your hand. He can walk up and down his rooms for hours
      and hours. I used to get so stiff and numb that I was afraid I would lose
      my balance and fall off the chair all at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept her hands folded in front of her, and her eyes, fixed on Miss
      Haldin&rsquo;s face, betrayed no animation whatever. Miss Haldin, gathering that
      the lady who called herself a <i>dame de compangnie</i> was proud of
      having acted as secretary to Peter Ivanovitch, made an amiable remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not imagine a more trying experience,&rdquo; declared the lady.
      &ldquo;There is an Anglo-American journalist interviewing Madame de S&mdash;
      now, or I would take you up,&rdquo; she continued in a changed tone and glancing
      towards the staircase. &ldquo;I act as master of ceremonies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Madame de S&mdash; could not bear Swiss servants about
      her person; and, indeed, servants would not stay for very long in the
      Chateau Borel. There were always difficulties. Miss Haldin had already
      noticed that the hall was like a dusty barn of marble and stucco with
      cobwebs in the corners and faint tracks of mud on the black and white
      tessellated floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look also after this animal,&rdquo; continued the <i>dame de compagnie</i>,
      keeping her hands folded quietly in front of her; and she bent her worn
      gaze upon the cat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind a bit. Animals have their rights; though,
      strictly speaking, I see no reason why they should not suffer as well as
      human beings. Do you? But of course they never suffer so much. That is
      impossible. Only, in their case it is more pitiful because they cannot
      make a revolution. I used to be a Republican. I suppose you are a
      Republican?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin confessed to me that she did not know what to say. But she
      nodded slightly, and asked in her turn&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you no longer a Republican?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After taking down Peter Ivanovitch from dictation for two years, it is
      difficult for me to be anything. First of all, you have to sit perfectly
      motionless. The slightest movement you make puts to flight the ideas of
      Peter Ivanovitch. You hardly dare to breathe. And as to coughing&mdash;God
      forbid! Peter Ivanovitch changed the position of the table to the wall
      because at first I could not help raising my eyes to look out of the
      window, while waiting for him to go on with his dictation. That was not
      allowed. He said I stared so stupidly. I was likewise not permitted to
      look at him over my shoulder. Instantly Peter Ivanovitch stamped his foot,
      and would roar, &lsquo;Look down on the paper!&rsquo; It seems my expression, my face,
      put him off. Well, I know that I am not beautiful, and that my expression
      is not hopeful either. He said that my air of unintelligent expectation
      irritated him. These are his own words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin was shocked, but admitted to me that she was not altogether
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that Peter Ivanovitch could treat any woman so rudely?&rdquo;
       she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dame de compagnie</i> nodded several times with an air of
      discretion, then assured Miss Haldin that she did not mind in the least.
      The trying part of it was to have the secret of the composition laid bare
      before her; to see the great author of the revolutionary gospels grope for
      words as if he were in the dark as to what he meant to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite willing to be the blind instrument of higher ends. To give
      one&rsquo;s life for the cause is nothing. But to have one&rsquo;s illusions destroyed&mdash;that
      is really almost more than one can bear. I really don&rsquo;t exaggerate,&rdquo; she
      insisted. &ldquo;It seemed to freeze my very beliefs in me&mdash;the more so
      that when we worked in winter Peter Ivanovitch, walking up and down the
      room, required no artificial heat to keep himself warm. Even when we move
      to the South of France there are bitterly cold days, especially when you
      have to sit still for six hours at a stretch. The walls of these villas on
      the Riviera are so flimsy. Peter Ivanovitch did not seem to be aware of
      anything. It is true that I kept down my shivers from fear of putting him
      out. I used to set my teeth till my jaws felt absolutely locked. In the
      moments when Peter Ivanovitch interrupted his dictation, and sometimes
      these intervals were very long&mdash;often twenty minutes, no less, while
      he walked to and fro behind my back muttering to himself&mdash;I felt I
      was dying by inches, I assure you. Perhaps if I had let my teeth rattle
      Peter Ivanovitch might have noticed my distress, but I don&rsquo;t think it
      would have had any practical effect. She&rsquo;s very miserly in such matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dame de compagnie</i> glanced up the staircase. The big cat had
      finished the milk and was rubbing its whiskered cheek sinuously against
      her skirt. She dived to snatch it up from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserliness is rather a quality than otherwise, you know,&rdquo; she continued,
      holding the cat in her folded arms. &ldquo;With us it is misers who can spare
      money for worthy objects&mdash;not the so-called generous natures. But
      pray don&rsquo;t think I am a sybarite. My father was a clerk in the Ministry of
      Finances with no position at all. You may guess by this that our home was
      far from luxurious, though of course we did not actually suffer from cold.
      I ran away from my parents, you know, directly I began to think by myself.
      It is not very easy, such thinking. One has got to be put in the way of
      it, awakened to the truth. I am indebted for my salvation to an old
      apple-woman, who had her stall under the gateway of the house we lived in.
      She had a kind wrinkled face, and the most friendly voice imaginable. One
      day, casually, we began to talk about a child, a ragged little girl we had
      seen begging from men in the streets at dusk; and from one thing to
      another my eyes began to open gradually to the horrors from which innocent
      people are made to suffer in this world, only in order that governments
      might exist. After I once understood the crime of the upper classes, I
      could not go on living with my parents. Not a single charitable word was
      to be heard in our home from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end; there was nothing
      but the talk of vile office intrigues, and of promotion and of salaries,
      and of courting the favour of the chiefs. The mere idea of marrying one
      day such another man as my father made me shudder. I don&rsquo;t mean that there
      was anyone wanting to marry me. There was not the slightest prospect of
      anything of the kind. But was it not sin enough to live on a Government
      salary while half Russia was dying of hunger? The Ministry of Finances!
      What a grotesque horror it is! What does the starving, ignorant people
      want with a Ministry of Finances? I kissed my old folks on both cheeks,
      and went away from them to live in cellars, with the proletariat. I tried
      to make myself useful to the utterly hopeless. I suppose you understand
      what I mean? I mean the people who have nowhere to go and nothing to look
      forward to in this life. Do you understand how frightful that is&mdash;nothing
      to look forward to! Sometimes I think that it is only in Russia that there
      are such people and such a depth of misery can be reached. Well, I plunged
      into it, and&mdash;do you know&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t much that one can do in
      there. No, indeed&mdash;at least as long as there are Ministries of
      Finances and such like grotesque horrors to stand in the way. I suppose I
      would have gone mad there just trying to fight the vermin, if it had not
      been for a man. It was my old friend and teacher, the poor saintly
      apple-woman, who discovered him for me, quite accidentally. She came to
      fetch me late one evening in her quiet way. I followed her where she would
      lead; that part of my life was in her hands altogether, and without her my
      spirit would have perished miserably. The man was a young workman, a
      lithographer by trade, and he had got into trouble in connexion with that
      affair of temperance tracts&mdash;you remember. There was a lot of people
      put in prison for that. The Ministry of Finances again! What would become
      of it if the poor folk ceased making beasts of themselves with drink? Upon
      my word, I would think that finances and all the rest of it are an
      invention of the devil; only that a belief in a supernatural source of
      evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.
      Finances indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hatred and contempt hissed in her utterance of the word &ldquo;finances,&rdquo; but at
      the very moment she gently stroked the cat reposing in her arms. She even
      raised them slightly, and inclining her head rubbed her cheek against the
      fur of the animal, which received this caress with the complete detachment
      so characteristic of its kind. Then looking at Miss Haldin she excused
      herself once more for not taking her upstairs to Madame S&mdash; The
      interview could not be interrupted. Presently the journalist would be seen
      coming down the stairs. The best thing was to remain in the hall; and
      besides, all these rooms (she glanced all round at the many doors), all
      these rooms on the ground floor were unfurnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively there is no chair down here to offer you,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;But
      if you prefer your own thoughts to my chatter, I will sit down on the
      bottom step here and keep silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin hastened to assure her that, on the contrary, she was very
      much interested in the story of the journeyman lithographer. He was a
      revolutionist, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A martyr, a simple man,&rdquo; said the <i>dame de compangnie</i>, with a faint
      sigh, and gazing through the open front door dreamily. She turned her
      misty brown eyes on Miss Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lived with him for four months. It was like a nightmare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Miss Haldin looked at her inquisitively she began to describe the
      emaciated face of the man, his fleshless limbs, his destitution. The room
      into which the apple-woman had led her was a tiny garret, a miserable den
      under the roof of a sordid house. The plaster fallen off the walls covered
      the floor, and when the door was opened a horrible tapestry of black
      cobwebs waved in the draught. He had been liberated a few days before&mdash;flung
      out of prison into the streets. And Miss Haldin seemed to see for the
      first time, a name and a face upon the body of that suffering people whose
      hard fate had been the subject of so many conversations, between her and
      her brother, in the garden of their country house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been arrested with scores and scores of other people in that affair
      of the lithographed temperance tracts. Unluckily, having got hold of a
      great many suspected persons, the police thought they could extract from
      some of them other information relating to the revolutionist propaganda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They beat him so cruelly in the course of investigation,&rdquo; went on the <i>dame
      de compagnie</i>, &ldquo;that they injured him internally. When they had done
      with him he was doomed. He could do nothing for himself. I beheld him
      lying on a wooden bedstead without any bedding, with his head on a bundle
      of dirty rags, lent to him out of charity by an old rag-picker, who
      happened to live in the basement of the house. There he was, uncovered,
      burning with fever, and there was not even a jug in the room for the water
      to quench his thirst with. There was nothing whatever&mdash;just that
      bedstead and the bare floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there no one in all that great town amongst the liberals and
      revolutionaries, to extend a helping hand to a brother?&rdquo; asked Miss Haldin
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But you do not know the most terrible part of that man&rsquo;s misery.
      Listen. It seems that they ill-used him so atrociously that, at last, his
      firmness gave way, and he did let out some information. Poor soul, the
      flesh is weak, you know. What it was he did not tell me. There was a
      crushed spirit in that mangled body. Nothing I found to say could make him
      whole. When they let him out, he crept into that hole, and bore his
      remorse stoically. He would not go near anyone he knew. I would have
      sought assistance for him, but, indeed, where could I have gone looking
      for it? Where was I to look for anyone who had anything to spare or any
      power to help? The people living round us were all starving and drunken.
      They were the victims of the Ministry of Finances. Don&rsquo;t ask me how we
      lived. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you. It was like a miracle of wretchedness. I had
      nothing to sell, and I assure you my clothes were in such a state that it
      was impossible for me to go out in the daytime. I was indecent. I had to
      wait till it was dark before I ventured into the streets to beg for a
      crust of bread, or whatever I could get, to keep him and me alive. Often I
      got nothing, and then I would crawl back and lie on the floor by the side
      of his couch. Oh yes, I can sleep quite soundly on bare boards. That is
      nothing, and I am only mentioning it to you so that you should not think I
      am a sybarite. It was infinitely less killing than the task of sitting for
      hours at a table in a cold study to take the books of Peter Ivanovitch
      from dictation. But you shall see yourself what that is like, so I needn&rsquo;t
      say any more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is by no means certain that I will ever take Peter Ivanovitch from
      dictation,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the other incredulously. &ldquo;Not certain? You mean to say that
      you have not made up your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Haldin assured her that there never had been any question of
      that between her and Peter Ivanovitch, the woman with the cat compressed
      her lips tightly for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you will find yourself settled at the table before you know that you
      have made up your mind. Don&rsquo;t make a mistake, it is disenchanting to hear
      Peter Ivanovitch dictate, but at the same time there is a fascination
      about it. He is a man of genius. Your face is certain not to irritate him;
      you may perhaps even help his inspiration, make it easier for him to
      deliver his message. As I look at you, I feel certain that you are the
      kind of woman who is not likely to check the flow of his inspiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin thought it useless to protest against all these assumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this man&mdash;this workman did he die under your care?&rdquo; she said,
      after a short silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dame de compagnie</i>, listening up the stairs where now two voices
      were alternating with some animation, made no answer for a time. When the
      loud sounds of the discussion had sunk into an almost inaudible murmur,
      she turned to Miss Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he died, but not, literally speaking, in my arms, as you might
      suppose. As a matter of fact, I was asleep when he breathed his last. So
      even now I cannot say I have seen anybody die. A few days before the end,
      some young men found us out in our extremity. They were revolutionists, as
      you might guess. He ought to have trusted in his political friends when he
      came out of prison. He had been liked and respected before, and nobody
      would have dreamed of reproaching him with his indiscretion before the
      police. Everybody knows how they go to work, and the strongest man has his
      moments of weakness before pain. Why, even hunger alone is enough to give
      one queer ideas as to what may be done. A doctor came, our lot was
      alleviated as far as physical comforts go, but otherwise he could not be
      consoled&mdash;poor man. I assure you, Miss Haldin, that he was very
      lovable, but I had not the strength to weep. I was nearly dead myself. But
      there were kind hearts to take care of me. A dress was found to clothe my
      nakedness. I tell you, I was not decent&mdash;and after a time the
      revolutionists placed me with a Jewish family going abroad, as governess.
      Of course I could teach the children, I finished the sixth class of the
      Lyceum; but the real object was, that I should carry some important papers
      across the frontier. I was entrusted with a packet which I carried next my
      heart. The gendarmes at the station did not suspect the governess of a
      Jewish family, busy looking after three children. I don&rsquo;t suppose those
      Hebrews knew what I had on me, for I had been introduced to them in a very
      roundabout way by persons who did not belong to the revolutionary
      movement, and naturally I had been instructed to accept a very small
      salary. When we reached Germany I left that family and delivered my papers
      to a revolutionist in Stuttgart; after this I was employed in various
      ways. But you do not want to hear all that. I have never felt that I was
      very useful, but I live in hopes of seeing all the Ministries destroyed,
      finances and all. The greatest joy of my life has been to hear what your
      brother has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She directed her round eyes again to the sunshine outside, while the cat
      reposed within her folded arms in lordly beatitude and sphinx-like
      meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I rejoiced,&rdquo; she began again. &ldquo;For me there is a heroic ring about
      the very name of Haldin. They must have been trembling with fear in their
      Ministries&mdash;all those men with fiendish hearts. Here I stand talking
      to you, and when I think of all the cruelties, oppressions, and injustices
      that are going on at this very moment, my head begins to swim. I have
      looked closely at what would seem inconceivable if one&rsquo;s own eyes had not
      to be trusted. I have looked at things that made me hate myself for my
      helplessness. I hated my hands that had no power, my voice that could not
      be heard, my very mind that would not become unhinged. Ah! I have seen
      things. And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin was moved. She shook her head slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have seen nothing for myself as yet,&rdquo; she murmured &ldquo;We have always
      lived in the country. It was my brother&rsquo;s wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a curious meeting&mdash;this&mdash;between you and me,&rdquo; continued
      the other. &ldquo;Do you believe in chance, Miss Haldin? How could I have
      expected to see you, his sister, with my own eyes? Do you know that when
      the news came the revolutionaries here were as much surprised as pleased,
      every bit? No one seemed to know anything about your brother. Peter
      Ivanovitch himself had not foreseen that such a blow was going to be
      struck. I suppose your brother was simply inspired. I myself think that
      such deeds should be done by inspiration. It is a great privilege to have
      the inspiration and the opportunity. Did he resemble you at all? Don&rsquo;t you
      rejoice, Miss Haldin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not expect too much from me,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin, repressing an
      inclination to cry which came over her suddenly. She succeeded, then added
      calmly, &ldquo;I am not a heroic person!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you couldn&rsquo;t have done such a thing yourself perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I must not even ask myself till I have lived a little
      longer, seen more....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other moved her head appreciatively. The purring of the cat had a loud
      complacency in the empty hall. No sound of voices came from upstairs. Miss
      Haldin broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it precisely that you heard people say about my brother? You said
      that they were surprised. Yes, I supposed they were. Did it not seem
      strange to them that my brother should have failed to save himself after
      the most difficult part&mdash;that is, getting away from the spot&mdash;was
      over? Conspirators should understand these things well. There are reasons
      why I am very anxious to know how it is he failed to escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dame de compagnie</i> had advanced to the open hall-door. She
      glanced rapidly over her shoulder at Miss Haldin, who remained within the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Failed to escape,&rdquo; she repeated absently. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he make the sacrifice
      of his life? Wasn&rsquo;t he just simply inspired? Wasn&rsquo;t it an act of
      abnegation? Aren&rsquo;t you certain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I am certain of,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin, &ldquo;is that it was not an act of
      despair. Have you not heard some opinion expressed here upon his miserable
      capture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dame de compagnie</i> mused for a while in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I hear? Of course, everything is discussed here. Has not all the
      world been speaking about your brother? For my part, the mere mention of
      his achievement plunges me into an envious ecstasy. Why should a man
      certain of immortality think of his life at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept her back turned to Miss Haldin. Upstairs from behind a great
      dingy white and gold door, visible behind the balustrade of the first
      floor landing, a deep voice began to drone formally, as if reading over
      notes or something of the sort. It paused frequently, and then ceased
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can stay any longer now,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin. &ldquo;I may return
      another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited for the <i>dame de compagnie</i> to make room for her exit; but
      the woman appeared lost in the contemplation of sunshine and shadows,
      sharing between themselves the stillness of the deserted grounds. She
      concealed the view of the drive from Miss Haldin. Suddenly she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be necessary; here is Peter Ivanovitch himself coming up. But
      he is not alone. He is seldom alone now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hearing that Peter Ivanovitch was approaching, Miss Haldin was not so
      pleased as she might have been expected to be. Somehow she had lost the
      desire to see either the heroic captive or Madame de S&mdash;, and the
      reason of that shrinking which came upon her at the very last minute is
      accounted for by the feeling that those two people had not been treating
      the woman with the cat kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you please let me pass?&rdquo; said Miss Haldin at last, touching lightly
      the shoulder of the <i>dame de compagnie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other, pressing the cat to her breast, did not budge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who is with him,&rdquo; she said, without even looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      More unaccountably than ever Miss Haldin felt a strong impulse to leave
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de S&mdash; may be engaged for some time yet, and what I have got
      to say to Peter Ivanovitch is just a simple question which I might put to
      him when I meet him in the grounds on my way down. I really think I must
      go. I have been some time here, and I am anxious to get back to my mother.
      Will you let me pass, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dame de compagnie</i> turned her head at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never supposed that you really wanted to see Madame de S&mdash;,&rdquo; she
      said, with unexpected insight. &ldquo;Not for a moment.&rdquo; There was something
      confidential and mysterious in her tone. She passed through the door, with
      Miss Haldin following her, on to the terrace, and they descended side by
      side the moss-grown stone steps. There was no one to be seen on the part
      of the drive visible from the front of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are hidden by the trees over there,&rdquo; explained Miss Haldin&rsquo;s new
      acquaintance, &ldquo;but you shall see them directly. I don&rsquo;t know who that
      young man is to whom Peter Ivanovitch has taken such a fancy. He must be
      one of us, or he would not be admitted here when the others come. You know
      what I mean by the others. But I must say that he is not at all mystically
      inclined. I don&rsquo;t know that I have made him out yet. Naturally I am never
      for very long in the drawing-room. There is always something to do for me,
      though the establishment here is not so extensive as the villa on the
      Riviera. But still there are plenty of opportunities for me to make myself
      useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the left, passing by the ivy-grown end of the stables, appeared Peter
      Ivanovitch and his companion. They walked very slowly, conversing with
      some animation. They stopped for a moment, and Peter Ivanovitch was seen
      to gesticulate, while the young man listened motionless, with his arms
      hanging down and his head bowed a little. He was dressed in a dark brown
      suit and a black hat. The round eyes of the <i>dame de compagnie</i>
      remained fixed on the two figures, which had resumed their leisurely
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An extremely polite young man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You shall see what a bow he
      will make; and it won&rsquo;t altogether be so exceptional either. He bows in
      the same way when he meets me alone in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved on a few steps, with Miss Haldin by her side, and things
      happened just as she had foretold. The young man took off his hat, bowed
      and fell back, while Peter Ivanovitch advanced quicker, his black, thick
      arms extended heartily, and seized hold of both Miss Haldin&rsquo;s hands, shook
      them, and peered at her through his dark glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; he exclaimed twice, approvingly. &ldquo;And so you
      have been looked after by....&rdquo; He frowned slightly at the <i>dame de
      compagnie</i>, who was still nursing the cat. &ldquo;I conclude Eleanor&mdash;Madame
      de S&mdash; is engaged. I know she expected somebody to-day. So the
      newspaper man did turn up, eh? She is engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all answer the <i>dame de compagnie</i> turned away her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very unfortunate&mdash;very unfortunate indeed. I very much regret
      that you should have been....&rdquo; He lowered suddenly his voice. &ldquo;But what is
      it&mdash;surely you are not departing, Natalia Victorovna? You got bored
      waiting, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Miss Haldin protested. &ldquo;Only I have been here some
      time, and I am anxious to get back to my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time seemed long, eh? I am afraid our worthy friend here&rdquo; (Peter
      Ivanovitch suddenly jerked his head sideways towards his right shoulder
      and jerked it up again),&mdash;&ldquo;our worthy friend here has not the art of
      shortening the moments of waiting. No, distinctly she has not the art; and
      in that respect good intentions alone count for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dame de compagnie</i> dropped her arms, and the cat found itself
      suddenly on the ground. It remained quite still after alighting, one hind
      leg stretched backwards. Miss Haldin was extremely indignant on behalf of
      the lady companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Peter Ivanovitch, that the moments I have passed in the hall
      of this house have been not a little interesting, and very instructive
      too. They are memorable. I do not regret the waiting, but I see that the
      object of my call here can be attained without taking up Madame de S&mdash;&lsquo;s
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point I interrupted Miss Haldin. The above relation is founded on
      her narrative, which I have not so much dramatized as might be supposed.
      She had rendered, with extraordinary feeling and animation, the very
      accent almost of the disciple of the old apple-woman, the irreconcilable
      hater of Ministries, the voluntary servant of the poor. Miss Haldin&rsquo;s true
      and delicate humanity had been extremely shocked by the uncongenial fate
      of her new acquaintance, that lady companion, secretary, whatever she was.
      For my own part, I was pleased to discover in it one more obstacle to
      intimacy with Madame de S&mdash;. I had a positive abhorrence for the
      painted, bedizened, dead-faced, glassy-eyed Egeria of Peter Ivanovitch. I
      do not know what was her attitude to the unseen, but I know that in the
      affairs of this world she was avaricious, greedy, and unscrupulous. It was
      within my knowledge that she had been worsted in a sordid and desperate
      quarrel about money matters with the family of her late husband, the
      diplomatist. Some very august personages indeed (whom in her fury she had
      insisted upon scandalously involving in her affairs) had incurred her
      animosity. I find it perfectly easy to believe that she had come to within
      an ace of being spirited away, for reasons of state, into some discreet <i>maison
      de sante</i>&mdash;a madhouse of sorts, to be plain. It appears, however,
      that certain high-placed personages opposed it for reasons which....
    </p>
    <p>
      But it&rsquo;s no use to go into details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wonder may be expressed at a man in the position of a teacher of languages
      knowing all this with such definiteness. A novelist says this and that of
      his personages, and if only he knows how to say it earnestly enough he may
      not be questioned upon the inventions of his brain in which his own belief
      is made sufficiently manifest by a telling phrase, a poetic image, the
      accent of emotion. Art is great! But I have no art, and not having
      invented Madame de S&mdash;, I feel bound to explain how I came to know so
      much about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My informant was the Russian wife of a friend of mine already mentioned,
      the professor of Lausanne University. It was from her that I learned the
      last fact of Madame de S&mdash;&lsquo;s history, with which I intend to trouble
      my readers. She told me, speaking positively, as a person who trusts her
      sources, of the cause of Madame de S&mdash;&lsquo;s flight from Russia, some
      years before. It was neither more nor less than this: that she became
      suspect to the police in connexion with the assassination of the Emperor
      Alexander. The ground of this suspicion was either some unguarded
      expressions that escaped her in public, or some talk overheard in her
      salon. Overheard, we must believe, by some guest, perhaps a friend, who
      hastened to play the informer, I suppose. At any rate, the overheard
      matter seemed to imply her foreknowledge of that event, and I think she
      was wise in not waiting for the investigation of such a charge. Some of my
      readers may remember a little book from her pen, published in Paris, a
      mystically bad-tempered, declamatory, and frightfully disconnected piece
      of writing, in which she all but admits the foreknowledge, more than hints
      at its supernatural origin, and plainly suggests in venomous innuendoes
      that the guilt of the act was not with the terrorists, but with a palace
      intrigue. When I observed to my friend, the professor&rsquo;s wife, that the
      life of Madame de S&mdash;, with its unofficial diplomacy, its intrigues,
      lawsuits, favours, disgrace, expulsions, its atmosphere of scandal,
      occultism, and charlatanism, was more fit for the eighteenth century than
      for the conditions of our own time, she assented with a smile, but a
      moment after went on in a reflective tone: &ldquo;Charlatanism?&mdash;yes, in a
      certain measure. Still, times are changed. There are forces now which were
      non-existent in the eighteenth century. I should not be surprised if she
      were more dangerous than an Englishman would be willing to believe. And
      what&rsquo;s more, she is looked upon as really dangerous by certain people&mdash;<i>chez
      nous</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Chez nous</i> in this connexion meant Russia in general, and the
      Russian political police in particular. The object of my digression from
      the straight course of Miss Haldin&rsquo;s relation (in my own words) of her
      visit to the Chateau Borel, was to bring forward that statement of my
      friend, the professor&rsquo;s wife. I wanted to bring it forward simply to make
      what I have to say presently of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s presence in Geneva, a little
      more credible&mdash;for this is a Russian story for Western ears, which,
      as I have observed already, are not attuned to certain tones of cynicism
      and cruelty, of moral negation, and even of moral distress already
      silenced at our end of Europe. And this I state as my excuse for having
      left Miss Haldin standing, one of the little group of two women and two
      men who had come together below the terrace of the Chateau Borel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge which I have just stated was in my mind when, as I have
      said, I interrupted Miss Haldin. I interrupted her with the cry of
      profound satisfaction&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you never saw Madame de S&mdash;, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin shook her head. It was very satisfactory to me. She had not
      seen Madame de S&mdash;! That was excellent, excellent! I welcomed the
      conviction that she would never know Madame de S&mdash; now. I could not
      explain the reason of the conviction but by the knowledge that Miss Haldin
      was standing face to face with her brother&rsquo;s wonderful friend. I preferred
      him to Madame de S&mdash; as the companion and guide of that young girl,
      abandoned to her inexperience by the miserable end of her brother. But, at
      any rate, that life now ended had been sincere, and perhaps its thoughts
      might have been lofty, its moral sufferings profound, its last act a true
      sacrifice. It is not for us, the staid lovers calmed by the possession of
      a conquered liberty, to condemn without appeal the fierceness of thwarted
      desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not ashamed of the warmth of my regard for Miss Haldin. It was, it
      must be admitted, an unselfish sentiment, being its own reward. The late
      Victor Haldin&mdash;in the light of that sentiment&mdash;appeared to me
      not as a sinister conspirator, but as a pure enthusiast. I did not wish
      indeed to judge him, but the very fact that he did not escape, that fact
      which brought so much trouble to both his mother and his sister, spoke to
      me in his favour. Meantime, in my fear of seeing the girl surrender to the
      influence of the Chateau Borel revolutionary feminism, I was more than
      willing to put my trust in that friend of the late Victor Haldin. He was
      nothing but a name, you will say. Exactly! A name! And what&rsquo;s more, the
      only name; the only name to be found in the correspondence between brother
      and sister. The young man had turned up; they had come face to face, and,
      fortunately, without the direct interference of Madame de S&mdash;. What
      will come of it? what will she tell me presently? I was asking myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only natural that my thought should turn to the young man, the
      bearer of the only name uttered in all the dream-talk of a future to be
      brought about by a revolution. And my thought took the shape of asking
      myself why this young man had not called upon these ladies. He had been in
      Geneva for some days before Miss Haldin heard of him first in my presence
      from Peter Ivanovitch. I regretted that last&rsquo;s presence at their meeting.
      I would rather have had it happen somewhere out of his spectacled sight.
      But I supposed that, having both these young people there, he introduced
      them to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I broke the silence by beginning a question on that point&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Peter Ivanovitch....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin gave vent to her indignation. Peter Ivanovitch directly he had
      got his answer from her had turned upon the <i>dame de compagnie</i> in a
      shameful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned upon her?&rdquo; I wondered. &ldquo;What about? For what reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was unheard of; it was shameful,&rdquo; Miss Haldin pursued, with angry
      eyes. &ldquo;<i>Il lui a fait une scene</i>&mdash;like this, before strangers.
      And for what? You would never guess. For some eggs.... Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was astonished. &ldquo;Eggs, did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Madame de S&mdash;. That lady observes a special diet, or something
      of the sort. It seems she complained the day before to Peter Ivanovitch
      that the eggs were not rightly prepared. Peter Ivanovitch suddenly
      remembered this against the poor woman, and flew out at her. It was most
      astonishing. I stood as if rooted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that the great feminist allowed himself to be abusive
      to a woman?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not that! It was something you have no conception of. It was an
      odious performance. Imagine, he raised his hat to begin with. He made his
      voice soft and deprecatory. &lsquo;Ah! you are not kind to us&mdash;you will not
      deign to remember....&rsquo; This sort of phrases, that sort of tone. The poor
      creature was terribly upset. Her eyes ran full of tears. She did not know
      where to look. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she would have preferred abuse, or
      even a blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not remark that very possibly she was familiar with both on
      occasions when no one was by. Miss Haldin walked by my side, her head up
      in scornful and angry silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great men have their surprising peculiarities,&rdquo; I observed inanely.
      &ldquo;Exactly like men who are not great. But that sort of thing cannot be kept
      up for ever. How did the great feminist wind up this very characteristic
      episode?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin, without turning her face my way, told me that the end was
      brought about by the appearance of the interviewer, who had been closeted
      with Madame de S&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came up rapidly, unnoticed, lifted his hat slightly, and paused to say
      in French: &ldquo;The Baroness has asked me, in case I met a lady on my way out,
      to desire her to come in at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After delivering this message, he hurried down the drive. The <i>dame de
      compagnie</i> flew towards the house, and Peter Ivanovitch followed her
      hastily, looking uneasy. In a moment Miss Haldin found herself alone with
      the young man, who undoubtedly must have been the new arrival from Russia.
      She wondered whether her brother&rsquo;s friend had not already guessed who she
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am in a position to say that, as a matter of fact, he had guessed. It is
      clear to me that Peter Ivanovitch, for some reason or other, had refrained
      from alluding to these ladies&rsquo; presence in Geneva. But Razumov had
      guessed. The trustful girl! Every word uttered by Haldin lived in
      Razumov&rsquo;s memory. They were like haunting shapes; they could not be
      exorcised. The most vivid amongst them was the mention of the sister. The
      girl had existed for him ever since. But he did not recognize her at once.
      Coming up with Peter Ivanovitch, he did observe her; their eyes had met,
      even. He had responded, as no one could help responding, to the harmonious
      charm of her whole person, its strength, its grace, its tranquil frankness&mdash;and
      then he had turned his gaze away. He said to himself that all this was not
      for him; the beauty of women and the friendship of men were not for him.
      He accepted that feeling with a purposeful sternness, and tried to pass
      on. It was only her outstretched hand which brought about the recognition.
      It stands recorded in the pages of his self-confession, that it nearly
      suffocated him physically with an emotional reaction of hate and dismay,
      as though her appearance had been a piece of accomplished treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced about. The considerable elevation of the terrace concealed them
      from anyone lingering in the doorway of the house; and even from the
      upstairs windows they could not have been seen. Through the thickets run
      wild, and the trees of the gently sloping grounds, he had cold, placid
      glimpses of the lake. A moment of perfect privacy had been vouchsafed to
      them at this juncture. I wondered to myself what use they had made of that
      fortunate circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have time for more than a few words?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      That animation with which she had related to me the incidents of her visit
      to the Chateau Borel had left her completely. Strolling by my side, she
      looked straight before her; but I noticed a little colour on her cheek.
      She did not answer me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some little time I observed that they could not have hoped to remain
      forgotten for very long, unless the other two had discovered Madame de S&mdash;
      swooning with fatigue, perhaps, or in a state of morbid exaltation after
      the long interview. Either would require their devoted ministrations. I
      could depict to myself Peter Ivanovitch rushing busily out of the house
      again, bareheaded, perhaps, and on across the terrace with his swinging
      gait, the black skirts of the frock-coat floating clear of his stout light
      grey legs. I confess to having looked upon these young people as the
      quarry of the &ldquo;heroic fugitive.&rdquo; I had the notion that they would not be
      allowed to escape capture. But of that I said nothing to Miss Haldin, only
      as she still remained uncommunicative, I pressed her a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;but you can tell me at least your impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head to look at me, and turned away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impression?&rdquo; she repeated slowly, almost dreamily; then in a quicker tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be a man who has suffered more from his thoughts than from
      evil fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From his thoughts, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is natural enough in a Russian,&rdquo; she took me up. &ldquo;In a young
      Russian; so many of them are unfit for action, and yet unable to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think he is that sort of man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not judge him. How could I, so suddenly? You asked for my
      impression&mdash;I explain my impression. I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know the
      world, nor yet the people in it; I have been too solitary&mdash;I am too
      young to trust my own opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust your instinct,&rdquo; I advised her. &ldquo;Most women trust to that, and make
      no worse mistakes than men. In this case you have your brother&rsquo;s letter to
      help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath like a light sigh. &ldquo;Unstained, lofty, and solitary
      existences,&rdquo; she quoted as if to herself. But I caught the wistful murmur
      distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High praise,&rdquo; I whispered to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The highest possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So high that, like the award of happiness, it is more fit to come only at
      the end of a life. But still no common or altogether unworthy personality
      could have suggested such a confident exaggeration of praise and...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; She interrupted me ardently. &ldquo;And if you had only known the heart
      from which that judgment has come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased on that note, and for a space I reflected on the character of
      the words which I perceived very well must tip the scale of the girl&rsquo;s
      feelings in that young man&rsquo;s favour. They had not the sound of a casual
      utterance. Vague they were to my Western mind and to my Western sentiment,
      but I could not forget that, standing by Miss Haldin&rsquo;s side, I was like a
      traveller in a strange country. It had also become clear to me that Miss
      Haldin was unwilling to enter into the details of the only material part
      of their visit to the Chateau Borel. But I was not hurt. Somehow I didn&rsquo;t
      feel it to be a want of confidence. It was some other difficulty&mdash;a
      difficulty I could not resent. And it was without the slightest resentment
      that I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. But on that high ground, which I will not dispute, you, like
      anyone else in such circumstances, you must have made for yourself a
      representation of that exceptional friend, a mental image of him, and&mdash;please
      tell me&mdash;you were not disappointed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? His personal appearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean precisely his good looks, or otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We turned at the end of the alley and made a few steps without looking at
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His appearance is not ordinary,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should have thought not&mdash;from the little you&rsquo;ve said of your
      first impression. After all, one has to fall back on that word.
      Impression! What I mean is that something indescribable which is likely to
      mark a &lsquo;not ordinary&rsquo; person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I perceived that she was not listening. There was no mistaking her
      expression; and once more I had the sense of being out of it&mdash;not
      because of my age, which at any rate could draw inferences&mdash;but
      altogether out of it, on another plane whence I could only watch her from
      afar. And so ceasing to speak I watched her stepping out by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;I could not have been disappointed with a
      man of such strong feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! Strong feeling,&rdquo; I muttered, thinking to myself censoriously: like
      this, at once, all in a moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; inquired Miss Haldin innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. I beg your pardon. Strong feeling. I am not surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know how abruptly I behaved to him!&rdquo; she cried
      remorsefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I must have appeared surprised, for, looking at me with a still
      more heightened colour, she said she was ashamed to admit that she had not
      been sufficiently collected; she had failed to control her words and
      actions as the situation demanded. She lost the fortitude worthy of both
      the men, the dead and the living; the fortitude which should have been the
      note of the meeting of Victor Haldin&rsquo;s sister with Victor Haldin&rsquo;s only
      known friend. He was looking at her keenly, but said nothing, and she was&mdash;she
      confessed&mdash;painfully affected by his want of comprehension. All she
      could say was: &ldquo;You are Mr. Razumov.&rdquo; A slight frown passed over his
      forehead. After a short, watchful pause, he made a little bow of assent,
      and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the thought that she had before her the man so highly regarded by her
      brother, the man who had known his value, spoken to him, understood him,
      had listened to his confidences, perhaps had encouraged him&mdash;her lips
      trembled, her eyes ran full of tears; she put out her hand, made a step
      towards him impulsively, saying with an effort to restrain her emotion,
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess who I am?&rdquo; He did not take the proffered hand. He even
      recoiled a pace, and Miss Haldin imagined that he was unpleasantly
      affected. Miss Haldin excused him, directing her displeasure at herself.
      She had behaved unworthily, like an emotional French girl. A manifestation
      of that kind could not be welcomed by a man of stern, self-contained
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have been stern indeed, or perhaps very timid with women, not to
      respond in a more human way to the advances of a girl like Nathalie Haldin&mdash;I
      thought to myself. Those lofty and solitary existences (I remembered the
      words suddenly) make a young man shy and an old man savage&mdash;often.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I encouraged Miss Haldin to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still very dissatisfied with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went from bad to worse,&rdquo; she said, with an air of discouragement very
      foreign to her. &ldquo;I did everything foolish except actually bursting into
      tears. I am thankful to say I did not do that. But I was unable to speak
      for quite a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had stood before him, speechless, swallowing her sobs, and when she
      managed at last to utter something, it was only her brother&rsquo;s name&mdash;&ldquo;Victor&mdash;Victor
      Haldin!&rdquo; she gasped out, and again her voice failed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she commented to me, &ldquo;this distressed him. He was quite
      overcome. I have told you my opinion that he is a man of deep feeling&mdash;it
      is impossible to doubt it. You should have seen his face. He positively
      reeled. He leaned against the wall of the terrace. Their friendship must
      have been the very brotherhood of souls! I was grateful to him for that
      emotion, which made me feel less ashamed of my own lack of self-control.
      Of course I had regained the power of speech at once, almost. All this
      lasted not more than a few seconds. &lsquo;I am his sister,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Maybe you
      have heard of me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had he?&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. How could it have been otherwise? And yet.... But what does
      that matter? I stood there before him, near enough to be touched and
      surely not looking like an impostor. All I know is, that he put out both
      his hands then to me, I may say flung them out at me, with the greatest
      readiness and warmth, and that I seized and pressed them, feeling that I
      was finding again a little of what I thought was lost to me for ever, with
      the loss of my brother&mdash;some of that hope, inspiration, and support
      which I used to get from my dear dead....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood quite well what she meant. We strolled on slowly. I refrained
      from looking at her. And it was as if answering my own thoughts that I
      murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt it was a great friendship&mdash;as you say. And that young man
      ended by welcoming your name, so to speak, with both hands. After that, of
      course, you would understand each other. Yes, you would understand each
      other quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment before I heard her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Razumov seems to be a man of few words. A reserved man&mdash;even
      when he is strongly moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unable to forget&mdash;-or even to forgive&mdash;the bass-toned
      expansiveness of Peter Ivanovitch, the Archpatron of revolutionary
      parties, I said that I took this for a favourable trait of character. It
      was associated with sincerity&mdash;in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, besides, we had not much time,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you would not have, of course.&rdquo; My suspicion and even dread of the
      feminist and his Egeria was so ineradicable that I could not help asking
      with real anxiety, which I made smiling&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you escaped all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She understood me, and smiled too, at my uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! I escaped, if you like to call it that. I walked away quickly.
      There was no need to run. I am neither frightened nor yet fascinated, like
      that poor woman who received me so strangely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr.&mdash;Mr. Razumov...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He remained there, of course. I suppose he went into the house after I
      left him. You remember that he came here strongly recommended to Peter
      Ivanovitch&mdash;possibly entrusted with important messages for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes! From that priest who...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Zosim&mdash;yes. Or from others, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You left him, then. But have you seen him since, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time Miss Haldin made no answer to this very direct question,
      then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been expecting to see him here to-day,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have! Do you meet, then, in this garden? In that case I had better
      leave you at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, why leave me? And we don&rsquo;t meet in this garden. I have not seen Mr.
      Razumov since that first time. Not once. But I have been expecting
      him....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. I wondered to myself why that young revolutionist should show
      so little alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we parted I told Mr. Razumov that I walked here for an hour every
      day at this time. I could not explain to him then why I did not ask him to
      come and see us at once. Mother must be prepared for such a visit. And
      then, you see, I do not know myself what Mr. Razumov has to tell us. He,
      too, must be told first how it is with poor mother. All these thoughts
      flashed through my mind at once. So I told him hurriedly that there was a
      reason why I could not ask him to see us at home, but that I was in the
      habit of walking here.... This is a public place, but there are never many
      people about at this hour. I thought it would do very well. And it is so
      near our apartments. I don&rsquo;t like to be very far away from mother. Our
      servant knows where I am in case I should be wanted suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is very convenient from that point of view,&rdquo; I agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, I thought the Bastions a very convenient place, since the girl
      did not think it prudent as yet to introduce that young man to her mother.
      It was here, then, I thought, looking round at that plot of ground of
      deplorable banality, that their acquaintance will begin and go on in the
      exchange of generous indignations and of extreme sentiments, too poignant,
      perhaps, for a non-Russian mind to conceive. I saw these two, escaped out
      of four score of millions of human beings ground between the upper and
      nether millstone, walking under these trees, their young heads close
      together. Yes, an excellent place to stroll and talk in. It even occurred
      to me, while we turned once more away from the wide iron gates, that when
      tired they would have plenty of accommodation to rest themselves. There
      was a quantity of tables and chairs displayed between the restaurant
      chalet and the bandstand, a whole raft of painted deals spread out under
      the trees. In the very middle of it I observed a solitary Swiss couple,
      whose fate was made secure from the cradle to the grave by the perfected
      mechanism of democratic institutions in a republic that could almost be
      held in the palm of ones hand. The man, colourlessly uncouth, was drinking
      beer out of a glittering glass; the woman, rustic and placid, leaning back
      in the rough chair, gazed idly around.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is little logic to be expected on this earth, not only in the matter
      of thought, but also of sentiment. I was surprised to discover myself
      displeased with that unknown young man. A week had gone by since they met.
      Was he callous, or shy, or very stupid? I could not make it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; I asked Miss Haldin, after we had gone some distance up
      the great alley, &ldquo;that Mr Razumov understood your intention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understood what I meant?&rdquo; she wondered. &ldquo;He was greatly moved. That I
      know! In my own agitation I could see it. But I spoke distinctly. He heard
      me; he seemed, indeed, to hang on my words...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously she had hastened her pace. Her utterance, too, became
      quicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited a little before I observed thoughtfully&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet he allowed all these days to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we tell what work he may have to do here? He is not an idler
      travelling for his pleasure. His time may not be his own&mdash;nor yet his
      thoughts, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowed her pace suddenly, and in a lowered voice added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or his very life&rdquo;&mdash;then paused and stood still &ldquo;For all I know, he
      may have had to leave Geneva the very day he saw me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without telling you!&rdquo; I exclaimed incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not give him time. I left him quite abruptly. I behaved emotionally
      to the end. I am sorry for it. Even if I had given him the opportunity he
      would have been justified in taking me for a person not to be trusted. An
      emotional, tearful girl is not a person to confide in. But even if he has
      left Geneva for a time, I am confident that we shall meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are confident.... I dare say. But on what ground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve told him that I was in great need of some one, a
      fellow-countryman, a fellow-believer, to whom I could give my confidence
      in a certain matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. I don&rsquo;t ask you what answer he made. I confess that this is good
      ground for your belief in Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s appearance before long. But he has
      not turned up to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;not to-day;&rdquo; and we stood for a time in silence,
      like people that have nothing more to say to each other and let their
      thoughts run widely asunder before their bodies go off their different
      ways. Miss Haldin glanced at the watch on her wrist and made a brusque
      movement. She had already overstayed her time, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be away from mother,&rdquo; she murmured, shaking her head. &ldquo;It
      is not that she is very ill now. But somehow when I am not with her I am
      more uneasy than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldin had not made the slightest allusion to her son for the last
      week or more. She sat, as usual, in the arm-chair by the window, looking
      out silently on that hopeless stretch of the Boulevard des Philosophes.
      When she spoke, a few lifeless words, it was of indifferent, trivial
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For anyone who knows what the poor soul is thinking of, that sort of talk
      is more painful than her silence. But that is bad too; I can hardly endure
      it, and I dare not break it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin sighed, refastening a button of her glove which had come
      undone. I knew well enough what a hard time of it she must be having. The
      stress, its causes, its nature, would have undermined the health of an
      Occidental girl; but Russian natures have a singular power of resistance
      against the unfair strains of life. Straight and supple, with a short
      jacket open on her black dress, which made her figure appear more slender
      and her fresh but colourless face more pale, she compelled my wonder and
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay a moment longer. You ought to come soon to see mother. You
      know she calls you &lsquo;<i>L&rsquo;ami.</i>&rsquo; It is an excellent name, and she really
      means it. And now <i>au revoir</i>; I must run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced vaguely down the broad walk&mdash;the hand she put out to me
      eluded my grasp by an unexpected upward movement, and rested upon my
      shoulder. Her red lips were slightly parted, not in a smile, however, but
      expressing a sort of startled pleasure. She gazed towards the gates and
      said quickly, with a gasp&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I knew it. Here he comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood that she must mean Mr. Razumov. A young man was walking up
      the alley, without haste. His clothes were some dull shade of brown, and
      he carried a stick. When my eyes first fell on him, his head was hanging
      on his breast as if in deep thought. While I was looking at him he raised
      it sharply, and at once stopped. I am certain he did, but that pause was
      nothing more perceptible than a faltering check in his gait,
      instantaneously overcome. Then he continued his approach, looking at us
      steadily. Miss Haldin signed to me to remain, and advanced a step or two
      to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned my head away from that meeting, and did not look at them again
      till I heard Miss Haldin&rsquo;s voice uttering his name in the way of
      introduction. Mr. Razumov was informed, in a warm, low tone, that, besides
      being a wonderful teacher, I was a great support &ldquo;in our sorrow and
      distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I was described also as an Englishman. Miss Haldin spoke
      rapidly, faster than I have ever heard her speak, and that by contrast
      made the quietness of her eyes more expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have given him my confidence,&rdquo; she added, looking all the time at Mr.
      Razumov. That young man did, indeed, rest his gaze on Miss Haldin, but
      certainly did not look into her eyes which were so ready for him.
      Afterwards he glanced backwards and forwards at us both, while the faint
      commencement of a forced smile, followed by the suspicion of a frown,
      vanished one after another; I detected them, though neither could have
      been noticed by a person less intensely bent upon divining him than
      myself. I don&rsquo;t know what Nathalie Haldin had observed, but my attention
      seized the very shades of these movements. The attempted smile was given
      up, the incipient frown was checked, and smoothed so that there should be
      no sign; but I imagined him exclaiming inwardly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her confidence! To this elderly person&mdash;this foreigner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I imagined this because he looked foreign enough to me. I was upon the
      whole favourably impressed. He had an air of intelligence and even some
      distinction quite above the average of the students and other inhabitants
      of the <i>Petite Russie</i>. His features were more decided than in the
      generality of Russian faces; he had a line of the jaw, a clean-shaven,
      sallow cheek; his nose was a ridge, and not a mere protuberance. He wore
      the hat well down over his eyes, his dark hair curled low on the nape of
      his neck; in the ill-fitting brown clothes there were sturdy limbs; a
      slight stoop brought out a satisfactory breadth of shoulders. Upon the
      whole I was not disappointed. Studious&mdash;robust&mdash;shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Miss Haldin had ceased speaking I felt the grip of his hand on
      mine, a muscular, firm grip, but unexpectedly hot and dry. Not a word or
      even a mutter assisted this short and arid handshake.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intended to leave them to themselves, but Miss Haldin touched me lightly
      on the forearm with a significant contact, conveying a distinct wish. Let
      him smile who likes, but I was only too ready to stay near Nathalie
      Haldin, and I am not ashamed to say that it was no smiling matter to me. I
      stayed, not as a youth would have stayed, uplifted, as it were poised in
      the air, but soberly, with my feet on the ground and my mind trying to
      penetrate her intention. She had turned to Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. This is the place. Yes, it is here that I meant you to come. I have
      been walking every day.... Don&rsquo;t excuse yourself&mdash;I understand. I am
      grateful to you for coming to-day, but all the same I cannot stay now. It
      is impossible. I must hurry off home. Yes, even with you standing before
      me, I must run off. I have been too long away.... You know how it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These last words were addressed to me. I noticed that Mr. Razumov passed
      the tip of his tongue over his lips just as a parched, feverish man might
      do. He took her hand in its black glove, which closed on his, and held it&mdash;detained
      it quite visibly to me against a drawing-back movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you once more for&mdash;for understanding me,&rdquo; she went on warmly.
      He interrupted her with a certain effect of roughness. I didn&rsquo;t like him
      speaking to this frank creature so much from under the brim of his hat, as
      it were. And he produced a faint, rasping voice quite like a man with a
      parched throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to thank me for? Understand you?... How did I understand
      you?... You had better know that I understand nothing. I was aware that
      you wanted to see me in this garden. I could not come before. I was
      hindered. And even to-day, you see...late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still held his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, at any rate, thank you for not dismissing me from your mind as a
      weak, emotional girl. No doubt I want sustaining. I am very ignorant. But
      I can be trusted. Indeed I can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ignorant,&rdquo; he repeated thoughtfully. He had raised his head, and
      was looking straight into her face now, while she held his hand. They
      stood like this for a long moment. She released his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You did come late. It was good of you to come on the chance of me
      having loitered beyond my time. I was talking with this good friend here.
      I was talking of you. Yes, Kirylo Sidorovitch, of you. He was with me when
      I first heard of your being here in Geneva. He can tell you what comfort
      it was to my bewildered spirit to hear that news. He knew I meant to seek
      you out. It was the only object of my accepting the invitation of Peter
      Ivanovitch....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch talked to you of me,&rdquo; he interrupted, in that wavering,
      hoarse voice which suggested a horribly dry throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little. Just told me your name, and that you had arrived here. Why
      should I have asked for more? What could he have told me that I did not
      know already from my brother&rsquo;s letter? Three lines! And how much they
      meant to me! I will show them to you one day, Kirylo Sidorovitch. But now
      I must go. The first talk between us cannot be a matter of five minutes,
      so we had better not begin....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had been standing a little aside, seeing them both in profile. At that
      moment it occurred to me that Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s face was older than his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If mother&rdquo;&mdash;the girl had turned suddenly to me, &ldquo;were to wake up in
      my absence (so much longer than usual) she would perhaps question me. She
      seems to miss me more, you know, of late. She would want to know what
      delayed me&mdash;and, you see, it would be painful for me to dissemble
      before her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood the point very well. For the same reason she checked what
      seemed to be on Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s part a movement to accompany her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! I go alone, but meet me here as soon as possible.&rdquo; Then to me in
      a lower, significant tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother may be sitting at the window at this moment, looking down the
      street. She must not know anything of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s presence here till&mdash;till
      something is arranged.&rdquo; She paused before she added a little louder, but
      still speaking to me, &ldquo;Mr. Razumov does not quite understand my
      difficulty, but you know what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick inclination of the head for us both, and an earnest, friendly
      glance at the young man, Miss Haldin left us covering our heads and
      looking after her straight, supple figure receding rapidly. Her walk was
      not that hybrid and uncertain gliding affected by some women, but a frank,
      strong, healthy movement forward. Rapidly she increased the distance&mdash;disappeared
      with suddenness at last. I discovered only then that Mr. Razumov, after
      ramming his hat well over his brow, was looking me over from head to foot.
      I dare say I was a very unexpected fact for that young Russian to stumble
      upon. I caught in his physiognomy, in his whole bearing, an expression
      compounded of curiosity and scorn, tempered by alarm&mdash;as though he
      had been holding his breath while I was not looking. But his eyes met mine
      with a gaze direct enough. I saw then for the first time that they were of
      a clear brown colour and fringed with thick black eyelashes. They were the
      youngest feature of his face. Not at all unpleasant eyes. He swayed
      slightly, leaning on his stick and generally hung in the wind. It flashed
      upon me that in leaving us together Miss Haldin had an intention&mdash;that
      something was entrusted to me, since, by a mere accident I had been found
      at hand. On this assumed ground I put all possible friendliness into my
      manner. I cast about for some right thing to say, and suddenly in Miss
      Haldin&rsquo;s last words I perceived the clue to the nature of my mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said gravely, if with a smile, &ldquo;you cannot be expected to
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His clean-shaven lip quivered ever so little before he said, as if
      wickedly amused&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you heard just now? I was thanked by that young lady for
      understanding so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him rather hard. Was there a hidden and inexplicable sneer in
      this retort? No. It was not that. It might have been resentment. Yes. But
      what had he to resent? He looked as though he had not slept very well of
      late. I could almost feel on me the weight of his unrefreshed, motionless
      stare, the stare of a man who lies unwinking in the dark, angrily passive
      in the toils of disastrous thoughts. Now, when I know how true it was, I
      can honestly affirm that this was the effect he produced on me. It was
      painful in a curiously indefinite way&mdash;for, of course, the definition
      comes to me now while I sit writing in the fullness of my knowledge. But
      this is what the effect was at that time of absolute ignorance. This new
      sort of uneasiness which he seemed to be forcing upon me I attempted to
      put down by assuming a conversational, easy familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That extremely charming and essentially admirable young girl (I am&mdash;as
      you see&mdash;old enough to be frank in my expressions) was referring to
      her own feelings. Surely you must have understood that much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made such a brusque movement that he even tottered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must understand this! Not expected to understand that! I may have other
      things to do. And the girl is charming and admirable. Well&mdash;and if
      she is! I suppose I can see that for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sally would have been insulting if his voice had not been practically
      extinct, dried up in his throat; and the rustling effort of his speech too
      painful to give real offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained silent, checked between the obvious fact and the subtle
      impression. It was open to me to leave him there and then; but the sense
      of having been entrusted with a mission, the suggestion of Miss Haldin&rsquo;s
      last glance, was strong upon me. After a moment of reflection I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we walk together a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders so violently that he tottered again. I saw it
      out of the corner of my eye as I moved on, with him at my elbow. He had
      fallen back a little and was practically out of my sight, unless I turned
      my head to look at him. I did not wish to indispose him still further by
      an appearance of marked curiosity. It might have been distasteful to such
      a young and secret refugee from under the pestilential shadow hiding the
      true, kindly face of his land. And the shadow, the attendant of his
      countrymen, stretching across the middle of Europe, was lying on him too,
      darkening his figure to my mental vision. &ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; I said to
      myself, &ldquo;he seems a sombre, even a desperate revolutionist; but he is
      young, he may be unselfish and humane, capable of compassion, of....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard him clear gratingly his parched throat, and became all attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is beyond everything,&rdquo; were his first words. &ldquo;It is beyond
      everything! I find you here, for no reason that I can understand, in
      possession of something I cannot be expected to understand! A confidant! A
      foreigner! Talking about an admirable Russian girl. Is the admirable girl
      a fool, I begin to wonder? What are you at? What is your object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was barely audible, as if his throat had no more resonance than a dry
      rag, a piece of tinder. It was so pitiful that I found it extremely easy
      to control my indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have lived a little longer, Mr. Razumov, you will discover that
      no woman is an absolute fool. I am not a feminist, like that illustrious
      author, Peter Ivanovitch, who, to say the truth, is not a little suspect
      to me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted me, in a surprising note of whispering astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspect to you! Peter Ivanovitch suspect to you! To you!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in a certain aspect he is,&rdquo; I said, dismissing my remark lightly.
      &ldquo;As I was saying, Mr. Razumov, when you have lived long enough, you will
      learn to discriminate between the noble trustfulness of a nature foreign
      to every meanness and the flattered credulity of some women; though even
      the credulous, silly as they may be, unhappy as they are sure to be, are
      never absolute fools. It is my belief that no woman is ever completely
      deceived. Those that are lost leap into the abyss with their eyes open, if
      all the truth were known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he cried at my elbow, &ldquo;what is it to me whether women are
      fools or lunatics? I really don&rsquo;t care what you think of them. I&mdash;I
      am not interested in them. I let them be. I am not a young man in a novel.
      How do you know that I want to learn anything about women?... What is the
      meaning of all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The object, you mean, of this conversation, which I admit I have forced
      upon you in a measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forced! Object!&rdquo; he repeated, still keeping half a pace or so behind me.
      &ldquo;You wanted to talk about women, apparently. That&rsquo;s a subject. But I don&rsquo;t
      care for it. I have never.... In fact, I have had other subjects to think
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am concerned here with one woman only&mdash;a young girl&mdash;the
      sister of your dead friend&mdash;Miss Haldin. Surely you can think a
      little of her. What I meant from the first was that there is a situation
      which you cannot be expected to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I listened to his unsteady footfalls by my side for the space of several
      strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that it may prepare the ground for your next interview with Miss
      Haldin if I tell you of it. I imagine that she might have had something of
      the kind in her mind when she left us together. I believe myself
      authorized to speak. The peculiar situation I have alluded to has arisen
      in the first grief and distress of Victor Haldin&rsquo;s execution. There was
      something peculiar in the circumstances of his arrest. You no doubt know
      the whole truth....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt my arm seized above the elbow, and next instant found myself swung
      so as to face Mr. Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spring up from the ground before me with this talk. Who the devil are
      you? This is not to be borne! Why! What for? What do you know what is or
      is not peculiar? What have you to do with any confounded circumstances, or
      with anything that happens in Russia, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned on his stick with his other hand, heavily; and when he let go my
      arm, I was certain in my mind that he was hardly able to keep on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit down at one of these vacant tables,&rdquo; I proposed, disregarding
      this display of unexpectedly profound emotion. It was not without its
      effect on me, I confess. I was sorry for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What tables? What are you talking about? Oh&mdash;the empty tables? The
      tables there. Certainly. I will sit at one of the empty tables.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I led him away from the path to the very centre of the raft of deals
      before the <i>chalet</i>. The Swiss couple were gone by that time. We were
      alone on the raft, so to speak. Mr. Razumov dropped into a chair, let fall
      his stick, and propped on his elbows, his head between his hands, stared
      at me persistently, openly, and continuously, while I signalled the waiter
      and ordered some beer. I could not quarrel with this silent inspection
      very well, because, truth to tell, I felt somewhat guilty of having been
      sprung on him with some abruptness&mdash;of having &ldquo;sprung from the
      ground,&rdquo; as he expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      While waiting to be served I mentioned that, born from parents settled in
      St. Petersburg, I had acquired the language as a child. The town I did not
      remember, having left it for good as a boy of nine, but in later years I
      had renewed my acquaintance with the language. He listened, without as
      much as moving his eyes the least little bit. He had to change his
      position when the beer came, and the instant draining of his glass revived
      him. He leaned back in his chair and, folding his arms across his chest,
      continued to stare at me squarely. It occurred to me that his
      clean-shaven, almost swarthy face was really of the very mobile sort, and
      that the absolute stillness of it was the acquired habit of a
      revolutionist, of a conspirator everlastingly on his guard against
      self-betrayal in a world of secret spies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are an Englishman&mdash;a teacher of English literature,&rdquo; he
      murmured, in a voice that was no longer issuing from a parched throat. &ldquo;I
      have heard of you. People told me you have lived here for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true. More than twenty years. And I have been assisting Miss Haldin
      with her English studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been reading English poetry with her,&rdquo; he said, immovable now,
      like another man altogether, a complete stranger to the man of the heavy
      and uncertain footfalls a little while ago&mdash;at my elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, English poetry,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But the trouble of which I speak was
      caused by an English newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to stare at me. I don&rsquo;t think he was aware that the story of
      the midnight arrest had been ferreted out by an English journalist and
      given to the world. When I explained this to him he muttered
      contemptuously, &ldquo;It may have been altogether a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you are the best judge of that,&rdquo; I retorted, a little
      disconcerted. &ldquo;I must confess that to me it looks to be true in the main.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell truth from lies?&rdquo; he queried in his new, immovable
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you do it in Russia,&rdquo; I began, rather nettled by his
      attitude. He interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Russia, and in general everywhere&mdash;in a newspaper, for instance.
      The colour of the ink and the shapes of the letters are the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there are other trifles one can go by. The character of the
      publication, the general verisimilitude of the news, the consideration of
      the motive, and so on. I don&rsquo;t trust blindly the accuracy of special
      correspondents&mdash;but why should this one have gone to the trouble of
      concocting a circumstantial falsehood on a matter of no importance to the
      world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on with us is of no
      importance&mdash;a mere sensational story to amuse the readers of the
      papers&mdash;the superior contemptuous Europe. It is hateful to think of.
      But let them wait a bit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off on this sort of threat addressed to the western world.
      Disregarding the anger in his stare, I pointed out that whether the
      journalist was well- or ill-informed, the concern of the friends of these
      ladies was with the effect the few lines of print in question had produced&mdash;the
      effect alone. And surely he must be counted as one of the friends&mdash;if
      only for the sake of his late comrade and intimate fellow-revolutionist.
      At that point I thought he was going to speak vehemently; but he only
      astounded me by the convulsive start of his whole body. He restrained
      himself, folded his loosened arms tighter across his chest, and sat back
      with a smile in which there was a twitch of scorn and malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a comrade and an intimate.... Very well,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ventured to speak to you on that assumption. And I cannot be mistaken.
      I was present when Peter Ivanovitch announced your arrival here to Miss
      Haldin, and I saw her relief and thankfulness when your name was
      mentioned. Afterwards she showed me her brother&rsquo;s letter, and read out the
      few words in which he alludes to you. What else but a friend could you
      have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously. That&rsquo;s perfectly well known. A friend. Quite correct.... Go
      on. You were talking of some effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said to myself: &ldquo;He puts on the callousness of a stern revolutionist,
      the insensibility to common emotions of a man devoted to a destructive
      idea. He is young, and his sincerity assumes a pose before a stranger, a
      foreigner, an old man. Youth must assert itself....&rdquo; As concisely as
      possible I exposed to him the state of mind poor Mrs. Haldin had been
      thrown into by the news of her son&rsquo;s untimely end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened&mdash;I felt it&mdash;with profound attention. His level stare
      deflected gradually downwards, left my face, and rested at last on the
      ground at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can enter into the sister&rsquo;s feelings. As you said, I have only read a
      little English poetry with her, and I won&rsquo;t make myself ridiculous in your
      eyes by trying to speak of her. But you have seen her. She is one of these
      rare human beings that do not want explaining. At least I think so. They
      had only that son, that brother, for a link with the wider world, with the
      future. The very groundwork of active existence for Nathalie Haldin is
      gone with him. Can you wonder then that she turns with eagerness to the
      only man her brother mentions in his letters. Your name is a sort of
      legacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could he have written of me?&rdquo; he cried, in a low, exasperated tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a few words. It is not for me to repeat them to you, Mr. Razumov;
      but you may believe my assertion that these words are forcible enough to
      make both his mother and his sister believe implicitly in the worth of
      your judgment and in the truth of anything you may have to say to them.
      It&rsquo;s impossible for you now to pass them by like strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused, and for a moment sat listening to the footsteps of the few
      people passing up and down the broad central walk. While I was speaking
      his head had sunk upon his breast above his folded arms. He raised it
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I go then and lie to that old woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not anger; it was something else, something more poignant, and not
      so simple. I was aware of it sympathetically, while I was profoundly
      concerned at the nature of that exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! Won&rsquo;t the truth do, then? I hoped you could have told them
      something consoling. I am thinking of the poor mother now. Your Russia <i>is</i>
      a cruel country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved a little in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;I thought you would have had something authentic to
      tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twitching of his lips before he spoke was curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if it is not worth telling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not worth&mdash;from what point of view? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From every point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke with some asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that anything which could explain the circumstances of
      that midnight arrest....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reported by a journalist for the amusement of the civilized Europe,&rdquo; he
      broke in scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, reported.... But aren&rsquo;t they true? I can&rsquo;t make out your attitude in
      this? Either the man is a hero to you, or...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He approached his face with fiercely distended nostrils close to mine so
      suddenly that I had the greatest difficulty in not starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me! I suppose it amuses you, all this. Look here! I am a worker.
      I studied. Yes, I studied very hard. There is intelligence here.&rdquo; (He
      tapped his forehead with his finger-tips.) &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think a Russian may
      have sane ambitions? Yes&mdash;I had even prospects. Certainly! I had. And
      now you see me here, abroad, everything gone, lost, sacrificed. You see me
      here&mdash;and you ask! You see me, don&rsquo;t you?&mdash;sitting before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw himself back violently. I kept outwardly calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see you here; and I assume you are here on account of the Haldin
      affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call it the Haldin affair&mdash;do you?&rdquo; he observed indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to ask you anything,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t presume. But in
      that case the mother and the sister of him who must be a hero in your eyes
      cannot be indifferent to you. The girl is a frank and generous creature,
      having the noblest&mdash;well&mdash;illusions. You will tell her nothing&mdash;or
      you will tell her everything. But speaking now of the object with which
      I&rsquo;ve approached you first, we have to deal with the morbid state of the
      mother. Perhaps something could be invented under your authority as a cure
      for a distracted and suffering soul filled with maternal affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His air of weary indifference was accentuated, I could not help thinking,
      wilfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. Something might,&rdquo; he mumbled carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand over his mouth to conceal a yawn. When he uncovered his
      lips they were smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. This has been a long conversation, and I have not had much
      sleep the last two nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This unexpected, somewhat insolent sort of apology had the merit of being
      perfectly true. He had had no nightly rest to speak of since that day
      when, in the grounds of the Chateau Borel, the sister of Victor Haldin had
      appeared before him. The perplexities and the complex terrors&mdash;I may
      say&mdash;of this sleeplessness are recorded in the document I was to see
      later&mdash;the document which is the main source of this narrative. At
      the moment he looked to me convincingly tired, gone slack all over, like a
      man who has passed through some sort of crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a lot of urgent writing to do,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose from my chair at once, and he followed my example, without haste, a
      little heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must apologize for detaining you so long,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why apologize? One can&rsquo;t very well go to bed before night. And you did
      not detain me. I could have left you at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not stayed with him to be offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you have been sufficiently interested,&rdquo; I said calmly. &ldquo;No
      merit of mine, though&mdash;the commonest sort of regard for the mother of
      your friend was enough.... As to Miss Haldin herself, she at one time was
      disposed to think that her brother had been betrayed to the police in some
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To my great surprise Mr. Razumov sat down again suddenly. I stared at him,
      and I must say that he returned my stare without winking for quite a
      considerable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some way,&rdquo; he mumbled, as if he had not understood or could not
      believe his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some unforeseen event, a sheer accident might have done that,&rdquo; I went on.
      &ldquo;Or, as she characteristically put it to me, the folly or weakness of some
      unhappy fellow-revolutionist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folly or weakness,&rdquo; he repeated bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a very generous creature,&rdquo; I observed after a time. The man
      admired by Victor Haldin fixed his eyes on the ground. I turned away and
      moved off, apparently unnoticed by him. I nourished no resentment of the
      moody brusqueness with which he had treated me. The sentiment I was
      carrying away from that conversation was that of hopelessness. Before I
      had got fairly clear of the raft of chairs and tables he had rejoined me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes!&rdquo; I heard him at my elbow again. &ldquo;But what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not look round even.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you people are under a curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no sound. It was only on the pavement outside the gate that I
      heard him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to walk with you a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all, I preferred this enigmatical young man to his celebrated
      compatriot, the great Peter Ivanovitch. But I saw no reason for being
      particularly gracious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going now to the railway station, by the shortest way from here, to
      meet a friend from England,&rdquo; I said, for all answer to his unexpected
      proposal. I hoped that something informing could come of it. As we stood
      on the curbstone waiting for a tramcar to pass, he remarked gloomily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like what you said just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stepped off the pavement together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great problem,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is to understand thoroughly the nature
      of the curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very difficult, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; he agreed with me, and his readiness, strangely enough,
      did not make him less enigmatical in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A curse is an evil spell,&rdquo; I tried him again. &ldquo;And the important, the
      great problem, is to find the means to break it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. To find the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was also an assent, but he seemed to be thinking of something else.
      We had crossed diagonally the open space before the theatre, and began to
      descend a broad, sparely frequented street in the direction of one of the
      smaller bridges. He kept on by my side without speaking for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not thinking of leaving Geneva soon?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for so long that I began to think I had been indiscreet, and
      should get no answer at all. Yet on looking at him I almost believed that
      my question had caused him something in the nature of positive anguish. I
      detected it mainly in the clasping of his hands, in which he put a great
      force stealthily. Once, however, he had overcome that sort of agonizing
      hesitation sufficiently to tell me that he had no such intention, he
      became rather communicative&mdash;at least relatively to the former
      off-hand curtness of his speeches. The tone, too, was more amiable. He
      informed me that he intended to study and also to write. He went even so
      far as to tell me he had been to Stuttgart. Stuttgart, I was aware, was
      one of the revolutionary centres. The directing committee of one of the
      Russian parties (I can&rsquo;t tell now which) was located in that town. It was
      there that he got into touch with the active work of the revolutionists
      outside Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been abroad before,&rdquo; he explained, in a rather inanimate
      voice now. Then, after a slight hesitation, altogether different from the
      agonizing irresolution my first simple question &ldquo;whether he meant to stay
      in Geneva&rdquo; had aroused, he made me an unexpected confidence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, I have received a sort of mission from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will keep you here in Geneva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Here. In this odious....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was satisfied with my faculty for putting two and two together when I
      drew the inference that the mission had something to do with the person of
      the great Peter Ivanovitch. But I kept that surmise to myself naturally,
      and Mr. Razumov said nothing more for some considerable time. It was only
      when we were nearly on the bridge we had been making for that he opened
      his lips again, abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I see that precious article anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had to think for a moment before I saw what he was referring to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been reproduced in parts by the Press here. There are files to be
      seen in various places. My copy of the English newspaper I have left with
      Miss Haldin, I remember, on the day after it reached me. I was
      sufficiently worried by seeing it lying on a table by the side of the poor
      mother&rsquo;s chair for weeks. Then it disappeared. It was a relief, I assure
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that you will find time to see these ladies
      fairly often&mdash;that you will make time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at me so queerly that I hardly know how to define his aspect. I
      could not understand it in this connexion at all. What ailed him? I asked
      myself. What strange thought had come into his head? What vision of all
      the horrors that can be seen in his hopeless country had come suddenly to
      haunt his brain? If it were anything connected with the fate of Victor
      Haldin, then I hoped earnestly he would keep it to himself for ever. I
      was, to speak plainly, so shocked that I tried to conceal my impression by&mdash;Heaven
      forgive me&mdash;a smile and the assumption of a light manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;that needn&rsquo;t cost you a great effort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away from me and leaned over the parapet of the bridge. For a
      moment I waited, looking at his back. And yet, I assure you, I was not
      anxious just then to look at his face again. He did not move at all. He
      did not mean to move. I walked on slowly on my way towards the station,
      and at the end of the bridge I glanced over my shoulder. No, he had not
      moved. He hung well over the parapet, as if captivated by the smooth rush
      of the blue water under the arch. The current there is swift, extremely
      swift; it makes some people dizzy; I myself can never look at it for any
      length of time without experiencing a dread of being suddenly snatched
      away by its destructive force. Some brains cannot resist the suggestion of
      irresistible power and of headlong motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It apparently had a charm for Mr. Razumov. I left him hanging far over the
      parapet of the bridge. The way he had behaved to me could not be put down
      to mere boorishness. There was something else under his scorn and
      impatience. Perhaps, I thought, with sudden approach to hidden truth, it
      was the same thing which had kept him over a week, nearly ten days indeed,
      from coming near Miss Haldin. But what it was I could not tell.

      PART THIRD
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      The water under the bridge ran violent and deep. Its slightly undulating
      rush seemed capable of scouring out a channel for itself through solid
      granite while you looked. But had it flowed through Razumov&rsquo;s breast, it
      could not have washed away the accumulated bitterness the wrecking of his
      life had deposited there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of all this?&rdquo; he thought, staring downwards at the
      headlong flow so smooth and clean that only the passage of a faint
      air-bubble, or a thin vanishing streak of foam like a white hair,
      disclosed its vertiginous rapidity, its terrible force. &ldquo;Why has that
      meddlesome old Englishman blundered against me? And what is this silly
      tale of a crazy old woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was trying to think brutally on purpose, but he avoided any mental
      reference to the young girl. &ldquo;A crazy old woman,&rdquo; he repeated to himself.
      &ldquo;It is a fatality! Or ought I to despise all this as absurd? But no! I am
      wrong! I can&rsquo;t afford to despise anything. An absurdity may be the
      starting-point of the most dangerous complications. How is one to guard
      against it? It puts to rout one&rsquo;s intelligence. The more intelligent one
      is the less one suspects an absurdity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wave of wrath choked his thoughts for a moment. It even made his body
      leaning over the parapet quiver; then he resumed his silent thinking, like
      a secret dialogue with himself. And even in that privacy, his thought had
      some reservations of which he was vaguely conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, this is not absurd. It is insignificant. It is absolutely
      insignificant&mdash;absolutely. The craze of an old woman&mdash;the fussy
      officiousness of a blundering elderly Englishman. What devil put him in
      the way? Haven&rsquo;t I treated him cavalierly enough? Haven&rsquo;t I just? That&rsquo;s
      the way to treat these meddlesome persons. Is it possible that he still
      stands behind my back, waiting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov felt a faint chill run down his spine. It was not fear. He was
      certain that it was not fear&mdash;not fear for himself&mdash;but it was,
      all the same, a sort of apprehension as if for another, for some one he
      knew without being able to put a name on the personality. But the
      recollection that the officious Englishman had a train to meet
      tranquillized him for a time. It was too stupid to suppose that he should
      be wasting his time in waiting. It was unnecessary to look round and make
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did the man mean by his extraordinary rigmarole about the
      newspaper, and that crazy old woman? he thought suddenly. It was a
      damnable presumption, anyhow, something that only an Englishman could be
      capable of. All this was a sort of sport for him&mdash;the sport of
      revolution&mdash;a game to look at from the height of his superiority. And
      what on earth did he mean by his exclamation, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the truth do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov pressed his folded arms to the stone coping over which he was
      leaning with force. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the truth do? The truth for the crazy old
      mother of the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man shuddered again. Yes. The truth would do! Apparently it
      would do. Exactly. And receive thanks, he thought, formulating the
      unspoken words cynically. &ldquo;Fall on my neck in gratitude, no doubt,&rdquo; he
      jeered mentally. But this mood abandoned him at once. He felt sad, as if
      his heart had become empty suddenly. &ldquo;Well, I must be cautious,&rdquo; he
      concluded, coming to himself as though his brain had been awakened from a
      trance. &ldquo;There is nothing, no one, too insignificant, too absurd to be
      disregarded,&rdquo; he thought wearily. &ldquo;I must be cautious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov pushed himself with his hand away from the balustrade and,
      retracing his steps along the bridge, walked straight to his lodgings,
      where, for a few days, he led a solitary and retired existence. He
      neglected Peter Ivanovitch, to whom he was accredited by the Stuttgart
      group; he never went near the refugee revolutionists, to whom he had been
      introduced on his arrival. He kept out of that world altogether. And he
      felt that such conduct, causing surprise and arousing suspicion, contained
      an element of danger for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to say that during these few days he never went out. I met him
      several times in the streets, but he gave me no recognition. Once, going
      home after an evening call on the ladies Haldin, I saw him crossing the
      dark roadway of the Boulevard des Philosophes. He had a broad-brimmed soft
      hat, and the collar of his coat turned up. I watched him make straight for
      the house, but, instead of going in, he stopped opposite the still lighted
      windows, and after a time went away down a side-street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that he had not been to see Mrs. Haldin yet. Miss Haldin told me he
      was reluctant; moreover, the mental condition of Mrs. Haldin had changed.
      She seemed to think now that her son was living, and she perhaps awaited
      his arrival. Her immobility in the great arm-chair in front of the window
      had an air of expectancy, even when the blind was down and the lamps
      lighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I was convinced that she had received her death-stroke; Miss
      Haldin, to whom, of course, I said nothing of my forebodings, thought that
      no good would come from introducing Mr. Razumov just then, an opinion
      which I shared fully. I knew that she met the young man on the Bastions.
      Once or twice I saw them strolling slowly up the main alley. They met
      every day for weeks. I avoided passing that way during the hour when Miss
      Haldin took her exercise there. One day, however, in a fit of
      absent-mindedness, I entered the gates and came upon her walking alone. I
      stopped to exchange a few words. Mr. Razumov failed to turn up, and we
      began to talk about him&mdash;naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you anything definite about your brother&rsquo;s activities&mdash;his
      end?&rdquo; I ventured to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Miss Haldin, with some hesitation. &ldquo;Nothing definite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I understood well enough that all their conversations must have been
      referred mentally to that dead man who had brought them together. That was
      unavoidable. But it was in the living man that she was interested. That
      was unavoidable too, I suppose. And as I pushed my inquiries I discovered
      that he had disclosed himself to her as a by no means conventional
      revolutionist, contemptuous of catchwords, of theories, of men too. I was
      rather pleased at that&mdash;but I was a little puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mind goes forward, far ahead of the struggle,&rdquo; Miss Haldin explained.
      &ldquo;Of course, he is an actual worker too,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you understand him?&rdquo; I inquired point-blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated again. &ldquo;Not altogether,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perceived that he had fascinated her by an assumption of mysterious
      reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I think?&rdquo; she went on, breaking through her reserved,
      almost reluctant attitude: &ldquo;I think that he is observing, studying me, to
      discover whether I am worthy of his trust....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that pleases you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept mysteriously silent for a moment. Then with energy, but in a
      confidential tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced;&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;that this extraordinary man is meditating
      some vast plan, some great undertaking; he is possessed by it&mdash;he
      suffers from it&mdash;and from being alone in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he&rsquo;s looking for helpers?&rdquo; I commented, turning away my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead brother, the dying mother, the foreign friend, had fallen into a
      distant background. But, at the same time, Peter Ivanovitch was absolutely
      nowhere now. And this thought consoled me. Yet I saw the gigantic shadow
      of Russian life deepening around her like the darkness of an advancing
      night. It would devour her presently. I inquired after Mrs. Haldin&mdash;that
      other victim of the deadly shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      A remorseful uneasiness appeared in her frank eyes. Mother seemed no
      worse, but if I only knew what strange fancies she had sometimes! Then
      Miss Haldin, glancing at her watch, declared that she could not stay a
      moment longer, and with a hasty hand-shake ran off lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly, Mr. Razumov was not to turn up that day. Incomprehensible
      youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      But less than an hour afterwards, while crossing the Place Mollard, I
      caught sight of him boarding a South Shore tramcar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to the Chateau Borel,&rdquo; I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      After depositing Razumov at the gates of the Chateau Borel, some half a
      mile or so from the town, the car continued its journey between two
      straight lines of shady trees. Across the roadway in the sunshine a short
      wooden pier jutted into the shallow pale water, which farther out had an
      intense blue tint contrasting unpleasantly with the green orderly slopes
      on the opposite shore. The whole view, with the harbour jetties of white
      stone underlining lividly the dark front of the town to the left, and the
      expanding space of water to the right with jutting promontories of no
      particular character, had the uninspiring, glittering quality of a very
      fresh oleograph. Razumov turned his back on it with contempt. He thought
      it odious&mdash;oppressively odious&mdash;in its unsuggestive finish: the
      very perfection of mediocrity attained at last after centuries of toil and
      culture. And turning his back on it, he faced the entrance to the grounds
      of the Chateau Borel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bars of the central way and the wrought-iron arch between the dark
      weather-stained stone piers were very rusty; and, though fresh tracks of
      wheels ran under it, the gate looked as if it had not been opened for a
      very long time. But close against the lodge, built of the same grey stone
      as the piers (its windows were all boarded up), there was a small side
      entrance. The bars of that were rusty too; it stood ajar and looked as
      though it had not been closed for a long time. In fact, Razumov, trying to
      push it open a little wider, discovered it was immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Democratic virtue. There are no thieves here, apparently,&rdquo; he muttered to
      himself, with displeasure. Before advancing into the grounds he looked
      back sourly at an idle working man lounging on a bench in the clean, broad
      avenue. The fellow had thrown his feet up; one of his arms hung over the
      low back of the public seat; he was taking a day off in lordly repose, as
      if everything in sight belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elector! Eligible! Enlightened!&rdquo; Razumov muttered to himself. &ldquo;A brute,
      all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov entered the grounds and walked fast up the wide sweep of the
      drive, trying to think of nothing&mdash;to rest his head, to rest his
      emotions too. But arriving at the foot of the terrace before the house he
      faltered, affected physically by some invisible interference. The
      mysteriousness of his quickened heart-beats startled him. He stopped short
      and looked at the brick wall of the terrace, faced with shallow arches,
      meagrely clothed by a few unthriving creepers, with an ill-kept narrow
      flower-bed along its foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here!&rdquo; he thought, with a sort of awe. &ldquo;It is here&mdash;on this
      very spot....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was tempted to flight at the mere recollection of his first meeting
      with Nathalie Haldin. He confessed it to himself; but he did not move, and
      that not because he wished to resist an unworthy weakness, but because he
      knew that he had no place to fly to. Moreover, he could not leave Geneva.
      He recognized, even without thinking, that it was impossible. It would
      have been a fatal admission, an act of moral suicide. It would have been
      also physically dangerous. Slowly he ascended the stairs of the terrace,
      flanked by two stained greenish stone urns of funereal aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the broad platform, where a few blades of grass sprouted on the
      discoloured gravel, the door of the house, with its ground-floor windows
      shuttered, faced him, wide open. He believed that his approach had been
      noted, because, framed in the doorway, without his tall hat, Peter
      Ivanovitch seemed to be waiting for his approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremonious black frock-coat and the bared head of Europe&rsquo;s greatest
      feminist accentuated the dubiousness of his status in the house rented by
      Madame de S&mdash;, his Egeria. His aspect combined the formality of the
      caller with the freedom of the proprietor. Florid and bearded and masked
      by the dark blue glasses, he met the visitor, and at once took him
      familiarly under the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov suppressed every sign of repugnance by an effort which the
      constant necessity of prudence had rendered almost mechanical. And this
      necessity had settled his expression in a cast of austere, almost
      fanatical, aloofness. The &ldquo;heroic fugitive,&rdquo; impressed afresh by the
      severe detachment of this new arrival from revolutionary Russia, took a
      conciliatory, even a confidential tone. Madame de S&mdash; was resting
      after a bad night. She often had bad nights. He had left his hat upstairs
      on the landing and had come down to suggest to his young friend a stroll
      and a good open-hearted talk in one of the shady alleys behind the house.
      After voicing this proposal, the great man glanced at the unmoved face by
      his side, and could not restrain himself from exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my word, young man, you are an extraordinary person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy you are mistaken, Peter Ivanovitch. If I were really an
      extraordinary person, I would not be here, walking with you in a garden in
      Switzerland, Canton of Geneva, Commune of&mdash;what&rsquo;s the name of the
      Commune this place belongs to?... Never mind&mdash;the heart of democracy,
      anyhow. A fit heart for it; no bigger than a parched pea and about as much
      value. I am no more extraordinary than the rest of us Russians, wandering
      abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Peter Ivanovitch dissented emphatically&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! You are not ordinary. I have some experience of Russians who are&mdash;well&mdash;living
      abroad. You appear to me, and to others too, a marked personality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean by this?&rdquo; Razumov asked himself, turning his eyes fully
      on his companion. The face of Peter Ivanovitch expressed a meditative
      seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose, Kirylo Sidorovitch, that I have not heard of you from
      various points where you made yourself known on your way here? I have had
      letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we are great in talking about each other,&rdquo; interjected Razumov, who
      had listened with great attention. &ldquo;Gossip, tales, suspicions, and all
      that sort of thing, we know how to deal in to perfection. Calumny, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In indulging in this sally, Razumov managed very well to conceal the
      feeling of anxiety which had come over him. At the same time he was saying
      to himself that there could be no earthly reason for anxiety. He was
      relieved by the evident sincerity of the protesting voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Peter Ivanovitch. &ldquo;What are you talking about? What
      reason can <i>you</i> have to...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great exile flung up his arms as if words had failed him in sober
      truth. Razumov was satisfied. Yet he was moved to continue in the same
      vein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking of the poisonous plants which flourish in the world of
      conspirators, like evil mushrooms in a dark cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are casting aspersions,&rdquo; remonstrated Peter Ivanovitch, &ldquo;which as far
      as you are concerned&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Razumov interrupted without heat. &ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t want to cast
      aspersions, but it&rsquo;s just as well to have no illusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch gave him an inscrutable glance of his dark spectacles,
      accompanied by a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who says that he has no illusions has at least that one,&rdquo; he
      said, in a very friendly tone. &ldquo;But I see how it is, Kirylo Sidorovitch.
      You aim at stoicism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoicism! That&rsquo;s a pose of the Greeks and the Romans. Let&rsquo;s leave it to
      them. We are Russians, that is&mdash;children; that is&mdash;sincere; that
      is&mdash;cynical, if you like. But that&rsquo;s not a pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence ensued. They strolled slowly under the lime-trees. Peter
      Ivanovitch had put his hands behind his back. Razumov felt the ungravelled
      ground of the deeply shaded walk damp and as if slippery under his feet.
      He asked himself, with uneasiness, if he were saying the right things. The
      direction of the conversation ought to have been more under his control,
      he reflected. The great man appeared to be reflecting on his side too. He
      cleared his throat slightly, and Razumov felt at once a painful
      reawakening of scorn and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished,&rdquo; began Peter Ivanovitch gently. &ldquo;Supposing you are right
      in your indictment, how can you raise any question of calumny or gossip,
      in your case? It is unreasonable. The fact is, Kirylo Sidorovitch, there
      is not enough known of you to give hold to gossip or even calumny. Just
      now you are a man associated with a great deed, which had been hoped for,
      and tried for too, without success. People have perished for attempting
      that which you and Haldin have done at last. You come to us out of Russia,
      with that prestige. But you cannot deny that you have not been
      communicative, Kirylo Sidorovitch. People you have met imparted their
      impressions to me; one wrote this, another that, but I form my own
      opinions. I waited to see you first. You are a man out of the common.
      That&rsquo;s positively so. You are close, very close. This taciturnity, this
      severe brow, this something inflexible and secret in you, inspires hopes
      and a little wonder as to what you may mean. There is something of a
      Brutus....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray spare me those classical allusions!&rdquo; burst out Razumov nervously.
      &ldquo;What comes Junius Brutus to do here? It is ridiculous! Do you mean to
      say,&rdquo; he added sarcastically, but lowering his voice, &ldquo;that the Russian
      revolutionists are all patricians and that I am an aristocrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch, who had been helping himself with a few gestures,
      clasped his hands again behind his back, and made a few steps, pondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>all</i> patricians,&rdquo; he muttered at last. &ldquo;But you, at any rate,
      are one of <i>us</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov smiled bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure my name is not Gugenheimer,&rdquo; he said in a sneering tone. &ldquo;I am
      not a democratic Jew. How can I help it? Not everybody has such luck. I
      have no name, I have no....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The European celebrity showed a great concern. He stepped back a pace and
      his arms flew in front of his person, extended, deprecatory, almost
      entreating. His deep bass voice was full of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear young friend!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My dear Kirylo Sidorovitch....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very patronymic you are so civil as to use when addressing me I have
      no legal right to&mdash;but what of that? I don&rsquo;t wish to claim it. I have
      no father. So much the better. But I will tell you what: my mother&rsquo;s
      grandfather was a peasant&mdash;a serf. See how much I am one of <i>you</i>.
      I don&rsquo;t want anyone to claim me. But Russia <i>can&rsquo;t</i> disown me. She
      cannot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov struck his breast with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am <i>it</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch walked on slowly, his head lowered. Razumov followed,
      vexed with himself. That was not the right sort of talk. All sincerity was
      an imprudence. Yet one could not renounce truth altogether, he thought,
      with despair. Peter Ivanovitch, meditating behind his dark glasses, became
      to him suddenly so odious that if he had had a knife, he fancied he could
      have stabbed him not only without compunction, but with a horrible,
      triumphant satisfaction. His imagination dwelt on that atrocity in spite
      of himself. It was as if he were becoming light-headed. &ldquo;It is not what is
      expected of me,&rdquo; he repeated to himself. &ldquo;It is not what is&mdash;I could
      get away by breaking the fastening on the little gate I see there in the
      back wall. It is a flimsy lock. Nobody in the house seems to know he is
      here with me. Oh yes. The hat! These women would discover presently the
      hat he has left on the landing. They would come upon him, lying dead in
      this damp, gloomy shade&mdash;but I would be gone and no one could
      ever...Lord! Am I going mad?&rdquo; he asked himself in a fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man was heard&mdash;musing in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes! That&mdash;no doubt&mdash;in a certain sense....&rdquo; He raised his
      voice. &ldquo;There is a deal of pride about you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intonation of Peter Ivanovitch took on a homely, familiar ring,
      acknowledging, in a way, Razumov&rsquo;s claim to peasant descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal of pride, brother Kirylo. And I don&rsquo;t say that you have no
      justification for it. I have admitted you had. I have ventured to allude
      to the facts of your birth simply because I attach no mean importance to
      it. You are one of us&mdash;<i>un des notres</i>. I reflect on that with
      satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I attach some importance to it also,&rdquo; said Razumov quietly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even
      deny that it may have some importance for you too,&rdquo; he continued, after a
      slight pause and with a touch of grimness of which he was himself aware,
      with some annoyance. He hoped it had escaped the perception of Peter
      Ivanovitch. &ldquo;But suppose we talk no more about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall not&mdash;not after this one time, Kirylo Sidorovitch,&rdquo;
       persisted the noble arch-priest of Revolution. &ldquo;This shall be the last
      occasion. You cannot believe for a moment that I had the slightest idea of
      wounding your feelings. You are clearly a superior nature&mdash;that&rsquo;s how
      I read you. Quite above the common&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;susceptibilities. But
      the fact is, Kirylo Sidorovitch, I don&rsquo;t know your susceptibilities.
      Nobody, out of Russia, knows much of you&mdash;as yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been watching me?&rdquo; suggested Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great man had spoken in a tone of perfect frankness, but as they
      turned their faces to each other Razumov felt baffled by the dark
      spectacles. Under their cover, Peter Ivanovitch hinted that he had felt
      for some time the need of meeting a man of energy and character, in view
      of a certain project. He said nothing more precise, however; and after
      some critical remarks upon the personalities of the various members of the
      committee of revolutionary action in Stuttgart, he let the conversation
      lapse for quite a long while. They paced the alley from end to end.
      Razumov, silent too, raised his eyes from time to time to cast a glance at
      the back of the house. It offered no sign of being inhabited. With its
      grimy, weather-stained walls and all the windows shuttered from top to
      bottom, it looked damp and gloomy and deserted. It might very well have
      been haunted in traditional style by some doleful, groaning, futile ghost
      of a middle-class order. The shades evoked, as worldly rumour had it, by
      Madame de S&mdash; to meet statesmen, diplomatists, deputies of various
      European Parliaments, must have been of another sort. Razumov had never
      seen Madame de S&mdash; but in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch came out of his abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two things I may say to you at once. I believe, first, that neither a
      leader nor any decisive action can come out of the dregs of a people. Now,
      if you ask me what are the dregs of a people&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;it would take
      too long to tell. You would be surprised at the variety of ingredients
      that for me go to the making up of these dregs&mdash;of that which ought,
      <i>must</i> remain at the bottom. Moreover, such a statement might be
      subject to discussion. But I can tell you what is <i>not</i> the dregs. On
      that it is impossible for us to disagree. The peasantry of a people is not
      the dregs; neither is its highest class&mdash;well&mdash;the nobility.
      Reflect on that, Kirylo Sidorovitch! I believe you are well fitted for
      reflection. Everything in a people that is not genuine, not its own by
      origin or development, is&mdash;well&mdash;dirt! Intelligence in the wrong
      place is that. Foreign-bred doctrines are that. Dirt! Dregs! The second
      thing I would offer to your meditation is this: that for us at this moment
      there yawns a chasm between the past and the future. It can never be
      bridged by foreign liberalism. All attempts at it are either folly or
      cheating. Bridged it can never be! It has to be filled up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sort of sinister jocularity had crept into the tones of the burly
      feminist. He seized Razumov&rsquo;s arm above the elbow, and gave it a slight
      shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand, enigmatical young man? It has got to be just filled
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov kept an unmoved countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that I have already gone beyond meditation on that
      subject?&rdquo; he said, freeing his arm by a quiet movement which increased the
      distance a little between himself and Peter Ivanovitch, as they went on
      strolling abreast. And he added that surely whole cartloads of words and
      theories could never fill that chasm. No meditation was necessary. A
      sacrifice of many lives could alone&mdash;He fell silent without finishing
      the phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch inclined his big hairy head slowly. After a moment he
      proposed that they should go and see if Madame de S&mdash; was now
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall get some tea,&rdquo; he said, turning out of the shaded gloomy walk
      with a brisker step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady companion had been on the look out. Her dark skirt whisked into
      the doorway as the two men came in sight round the corner. She ran off
      somewhere altogether, and had disappeared when they entered the hall. In
      the crude light falling from the dusty glass skylight upon the black and
      white tessellated floor, covered with muddy tracks, their footsteps echoed
      faintly. The great feminist led the way up the stairs. On the balustrade
      of the first-floor landing a shiny tall hat reposed, rim upwards, opposite
      the double door of the drawing-room, haunted, it was said, by evoked
      ghosts, and frequented, it was to be supposed, by fugitive revolutionists.
      The cracked white paint of the panels, the tarnished gilt of the
      mouldings, permitted one to imagine nothing but dust and emptiness within.
      Before turning the massive brass handle, Peter Ivanovitch gave his young
      companion a sharp, partly critical, partly preparatory glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one is perfect,&rdquo; he murmured discreetly. Thus, the possessor of a rare
      jewel might, before opening the casket, warn the profane that no gem
      perhaps is flawless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained with his hand on the door-handle so long that Razumov assented
      by a moody &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfection itself would not produce that effect,&rdquo; pursued Peter
      Ivanovitch, &ldquo;in a world not meant for it. But you shall find there a mind&mdash;no!&mdash;the
      quintessence of feminine intuition which will understand any perplexity
      you may be suffering from by the irresistible, enlightening force of
      sympathy. Nothing can remain obscure before that&mdash;that&mdash;inspired,
      yes, inspired penetration, this true light of femininity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gaze of the dark spectacles in its glossy steadfastness gave his face
      an air of absolute conviction. Razumov felt a momentary shrinking before
      that closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penetration? Light,&rdquo; he stammered out. &ldquo;Do you mean some sort of
      thought-reading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch seemed shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean something utterly different,&rdquo; he retorted, with a faint, pitying
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov began to feel angry, very much against his wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very mysterious,&rdquo; he muttered through his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t object to being understood, to being guided?&rdquo; queried the great
      feminist. Razumov exploded in a fierce whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what sense? Be pleased to understand that I am a serious person. Who
      do you take me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other very closely. Razumov&rsquo;s temper was cooled by the
      impenetrable earnestness of the blue glasses meeting his stare. Peter
      Ivanovitch turned the handle at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall know directly,&rdquo; he said, pushing the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low-pitched grating voice was heard within the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Enfin</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the doorway, his black-coated bulk blocking the view, Peter Ivanovitch
      boomed in a hearty tone with something boastful in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Here I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced over his shoulder at Razumov, who waited for him to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am bringing you a proved conspirator&mdash;a real one this time. <i>Un
      vrai celui la</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This pause in the doorway gave the &ldquo;proved conspirator&rdquo; time to make sure
      that his face did not betray his angry curiosity and his mental disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      These sentiments stand confessed in Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s memorandum of his first
      interview with Madame de S&mdash;. The very words I use in my narrative
      are written where their sincerity cannot be suspected. The record, which
      could not have been meant for anyone&rsquo;s eyes but his own, was not, I think,
      the outcome of that strange impulse of indiscretion common to men who lead
      secret lives, and accounting for the invariable existence of &ldquo;compromising
      documents&rdquo; in all the plots and conspiracies of history. Mr. Razumov
      looked at it, I suppose, as a man looks at himself in a mirror, with
      wonder, perhaps with anguish, with anger or despair. Yes, as a threatened
      man may look fearfully at his own face in the glass, formulating to
      himself reassuring excuses for his appearance marked by the taint of some
      insidious hereditary disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egeria of the &ldquo;Russian Mazzini&rdquo; produced, at first view, a strong
      effect by the death-like immobility of an obviously painted face. The eyes
      appeared extraordinarily brilliant. The figure, in a close-fitting dress,
      admirably made, but by no means fresh, had an elegant stiffness. The
      rasping voice inviting him to sit down; the rigidity of the upright
      attitude with one arm extended along the back of the sofa, the white gleam
      of the big eyeballs setting off the black, fathomless stare of the
      enlarged pupils, impressed Razumov more than anything he had seen since
      his hasty and secret departure from St. Petersburg. A witch in Parisian
      clothes, he thought. A portent! He actually hesitated in his advance, and
      did not even comprehend, at first, what the rasping voice was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down. Draw your chair nearer me. There&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down. At close quarters the rouged cheekbones, the wrinkles, the
      fine lines on each side of the vivid lips, astounded him. He was being
      received graciously, with a smile which made him think of a grinning
      skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been hearing about you for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what to say, and murmured some disconnected words. The
      grinning skull effect vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know that the general complaint is that you have shown
      yourself very reserved everywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov remained silent for a time, thinking of his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, don&rsquo;t you see, am a man of action,&rdquo; he said huskily, glancing upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch stood in portentous expectant silence by the side of his
      chair. A slight feeling of nausea came over Razumov. What could be the
      relations of these two people to each other? She like a galvanized corpse
      out of some Hoffman&rsquo;s Tale&mdash;he the preacher of feminist gospel for
      all the world, and a super-revolutionist besides! This ancient, painted
      mummy with unfathomable eyes, and this burly, bull-necked,
      deferential...what was it? Witchcraft, fascination.... &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for her
      money,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She has millions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walls, the floor of the room were bare like a barn. The few pieces of
      furniture had been discovered in the garrets and dragged down into service
      without having been properly dusted, even. It was the refuse the banker&rsquo;s
      widow had left behind her. The windows without curtains had an indigent,
      sleepless look. In two of them the dirty yellowy-white blinds had been
      pulled down. All this spoke, not of poverty, but of sordid penuriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hoarse voice on the sofa uttered angrily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking round, Kirylo Sidorovitch. I have been shamefully robbed,
      positively ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A rattling laugh, which seemed beyond her control, interrupted her for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A slavish nature would find consolation in the fact that the principal
      robber was an exalted and almost a sacrosanct person&mdash;a Grand Duke,
      in fact. Do you understand, Mr. Razumov? A Grand Duke&mdash;No! You have
      no idea what thieves those people are! Downright thieves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her bosom heaved, but her left arm remained rigidly extended along the
      back of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will only upset yourself,&rdquo; breathed out a deep voice, which, to
      Razumov&rsquo;s startled glance, seemed to proceed from under the steady
      spectacles of Peter Ivanovitch, rather than from his lips, which had
      hardly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of hat? I say thieves! <i>Voleurs! Voleurs!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov was quite confounded by this unexpected clamour, which had in it
      something of wailing and croaking, and more than a suspicion of hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Voleurs! Voleurs! Vol</i>....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No power on earth can rob you of your genius,&rdquo; shouted Peter Ivanovitch
      in an overpowering bass, but without stirring, without a gesture of any
      kind. A profound silence fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov remained outwardly impassive. &ldquo;What is the meaning of this
      performance?&rdquo; he was asking himself. But with a preliminary sound of
      bumping outside some door behind him, the lady companion, in a threadbare
      black skirt and frayed blouse, came in rapidly, walking on her heels, and
      carrying in both hands a big Russian samovar, obviously too heavy for her.
      Razumov made an instinctive movement to help, which startled her so much
      that she nearly dropped her hissing burden. She managed, however, to land
      it on the table, and looked so frightened that Razumov hastened to sit
      down. She produced then, from an adjacent room, four glass tumblers, a
      teapot, and a sugar-basin, on a black iron tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rasping voice asked from the sofa abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Les gateaux</i>? Have you remembered to bring the cakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch, without a word, marched out on to the landing, and
      returned instantly with a parcel wrapped up in white glazed paper, which
      he must have extracted from the interior of his hat. With imperturbable
      gravity he undid the string and smoothed the paper open on a part of the
      table within reach of Madame de S&mdash;&lsquo;s hand. The lady companion poured
      out the tea, then retired into a distant corner out of everybody&rsquo;s sight.
      From time to time Madame de S&mdash; extended a claw-like hand, glittering
      with costly rings, towards the paper of cakes, took up one and devoured
      it, displaying her big false teeth ghoulishly. Meantime she talked in a
      hoarse tone of the political situation in the Balkans. She built great
      hopes on some complication in the peninsula for arousing a great movement
      of national indignation in Russia against &ldquo;these thieves&mdash;thieves
      thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will only upset yourself,&rdquo; Peter Ivanovitch interposed, raising his
      glassy gaze. He smoked cigarettes and drank tea in silence, continuously.
      When he had finished a glass, he flourished his hand above his shoulder.
      At that signal the lady companion, ensconced in her corner, with round
      eyes like a watchful animal, would dart out to the table and pour him out
      another tumblerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked at her once or twice. She was anxious, tremulous, though
      neither Madame de S&mdash; nor Peter Ivanovitch paid the slightest
      attention to her. &ldquo;What have they done between them to that forlorn
      creature?&rdquo; Razumov asked himself. &ldquo;Have they terrified her out of her
      senses with ghosts, or simply have they only been beating her?&rdquo; When she
      gave him his second glass of tea, he noticed that her lips trembled in the
      manner of a scared person about to burst into speech. But of course she
      said nothing, and retired into her corner, as if hugging to herself the
      smile of thanks he gave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be worth cultivating,&rdquo; thought Razumov suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was calming down, getting hold of the actuality into which he had been
      thrown&mdash;for the first time perhaps since Victor Haldin had entered
      his room...and had gone out again. He was distinctly aware of being the
      object of the famous&mdash;or notorious&mdash;Madame de S&mdash;&lsquo;s ghastly
      graciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de S&mdash; was pleased to discover that this young man was
      different from the other types of revolutionist members of committees,
      secret emissaries, vulgar and unmannerly fugitive professors, rough
      students, ex-cobblers with apostolic faces, consumptive and ragged
      enthusiasts, Hebrew youths, common fellows of all sorts that used to come
      and go around Peter Ivanovitch&mdash;fanatics, pedants, proletarians all.
      It was pleasant to talk to this young man of notably good appearance&mdash;for
      Madame de S&mdash; was not always in a mystical state of mind. Razumov&rsquo;s
      taciturnity only excited her to a quicker, more voluble utterance. It
      still dealt with the Balkans. She knew all the statesmen of that region,
      Turks, Bulgarians, Montenegrins, Roumanians, Greeks, Armenians, and
      nondescripts, young and old, the living and the dead. With some money an
      intrigue could be started which would set the Peninsula in a blaze and
      outrage the sentiment of the Russian people. A cry of abandoned brothers
      could be raised, and then, with the nation seething with indignation, a
      couple of regiments or so would be enough to begin a military revolution
      in St. Petersburg and make an end of these thieves....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently I&rsquo;ve got only to sit still and listen,&rdquo; the silent Razumov
      thought to himself. &ldquo;As to that hairy and obscene brute&rdquo; (in such terms
      did Mr. Razumov refer mentally to the popular expounder of a feministic
      conception of social state), &ldquo;as to him, for all his cunning he too shall
      speak out some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov ceased to think for a moment. Then a sombre-toned reflection
      formulated itself in his mind, ironical and bitter. &ldquo;I have the gift of
      inspiring confidence.&rdquo; He heard himself laughing aloud. It was like a goad
      to the painted, shiny-eyed harridan on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well laugh!&rdquo; she cried hoarsely. &ldquo;What else can one do! Perfect
      swindlers&mdash;and what base swindlers at that! Cheap Germans&mdash;Holstein-Gottorps!
      Though, indeed, it&rsquo;s hardly safe to say who and what they are. A family
      that counts a creature like Catherine the Great in its ancestry&mdash;you
      understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are only upsetting yourself,&rdquo; said Peter Ivanovitch, patiently but in
      a firm tone. This admonition had its usual effect on the Egeria. She
      dropped her thick, discoloured eyelids and changed her position on the
      sofa. All her angular and lifeless movements seemed completely automatic
      now that her eyes were closed. Presently she opened them very full. Peter
      Ivanovitch drank tea steadily, without haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; She addressed Razumov directly. &ldquo;The people who have
      seen you on your way here are right. You are very reserved. You haven&rsquo;t
      said twenty words altogether since you came in. You let nothing of your
      thoughts be seen in your face either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been listening, Madame,&rdquo; said Razumov, using French for the first
      time, hesitatingly, not being certain of his accent. But it seemed to
      produce an excellent impression. Madame de S&mdash; looked meaningly into
      Peter Ivanovitch&rsquo;s spectacles, as if to convey her conviction of this
      young man&rsquo;s merit. She even nodded the least bit in his direction, and
      Razumov heard her murmur under her breath the words, &ldquo;Later on in the
      diplomatic service,&rdquo; which could not but refer to the favourable
      impression he had made. The fantastic absurdity of it revolted him because
      it seemed to outrage his ruined hopes with the vision of a mock-career.
      Peter Ivanovitch, impassive as though he were deaf, drank some more tea.
      Razumov felt that he must say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he began deliberately, as if uttering a meditated opinion.
      &ldquo;Clearly. Even in planning a purely military revolution the temper of the
      people should be taken into account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have understood me perfectly. The discontent should be spiritualized.
      That is what the ordinary heads of revolutionary committees will not
      understand. They aren&rsquo;t capable of it. For instance, Mordatiev was in
      Geneva last month. Peter Ivanovitch brought him here. You know Mordatiev?
      Well, yes&mdash;you have heard of him. They call him an eagle&mdash;a
      hero! He has never done half as much as you have. Never attempted&mdash;not
      half....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de S&mdash; agitated herself angularly on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, of course, talked to him. And do you know what he said to me? &lsquo;What
      have we to do with Balkan intrigues? We must simply extirpate the
      scoundrels.&rsquo; Extirpate is all very well&mdash;but what then? The imbecile!
      I screamed at him, &lsquo;But you must spiritualize&mdash;don&rsquo;t you understand?&mdash;spiritualize
      the discontent.&rsquo;...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt nervously in her pocket for a handkerchief; she pressed it to her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spiritualize?&rdquo; said Razumov interrogatively, watching her heaving breast.
      The long ends of an old black lace scarf she wore over her head slipped
      off her shoulders and hung down on each side of her ghastly rosy cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An odious creature,&rdquo; she burst out again. &ldquo;Imagine a man who takes five
      lumps of sugar in his tea.... Yes, I said spiritualize! How else can you
      make discontent effective and universal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to this, young man.&rdquo; Peter Ivanovitch made himself heard solemnly.
      &ldquo;Effective and universal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked at him suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some say hunger will do that,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I know. Our people are starving in heaps. But you can&rsquo;t make famine
      universal. And it is not despair that we want to create. There is no moral
      support to be got out of that. It is indignation....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de S&mdash; let her thin, extended arm sink on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a Mordatiev,&rdquo; began Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien sur!&rdquo; murmured Madame de S&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I too am ready to say extirpate, extirpate! But in my ignorance of
      political work, permit me to ask: A Balkan&mdash;well&mdash;intrigue,
      wouldn&rsquo;t that take a very long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch got up and moved off quietly, to stand with his face to
      the window. Razumov heard a door close; he turned his head and perceived
      that the lady companion had scuttled out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In matters of politics I am a supernaturalist.&rdquo; Madame de S&mdash; broke
      the silence harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch moved away from the window and struck Razumov lightly on
      the shoulder. This was a signal for leaving, but at the same time he
      addressed Madame de S&mdash; in a peculiar reminding tone&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever it meant, she did not seem to hear him. She leaned back in the
      corner of the sofa like a wooden figure. The immovable peevishness of the
      face, framed in the limp, rusty lace, had a character of cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to extirpating,&rdquo; she croaked at the attentive Razumov, &ldquo;there is only
      one class in Russia which must be extirpated. Only one. And that class
      consists of only one family. You understand me? That one family must be
      extirpated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her rigidity was frightful, like the rigor of a corpse galvanized into
      harsh speech and glittering stare by the force of murderous hate. The
      sight fascinated Razumov&mdash;yet he felt more self-possessed than at any
      other time since he had entered this weirdly bare room. He was interested.
      But the great feminist by his side again uttered his appeal&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disregarded it. Her carmine lips vaticinated with an extraordinary
      rapidity. The liberating spirit would use arms before which rivers would
      part like Jordan, and ramparts fall down like the walls of Jericho. The
      deliverance from bondage would be effected by plagues and by signs, by
      wonders and by war. The women....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleanor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased; she had heard him at last. She pressed her hand to her
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Ah yes! That girl&mdash;the sister of....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Miss Haldin that she meant. That young girl and her mother had been
      leading a very retired life. They were provincial ladies&mdash;were they
      not? The mother had been very beautiful&mdash;traces were left yet. Peter
      Ivanovitch, when he called there for the first time, was greatly
      struck....But the cold way they received him was really surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is one of our national glories,&rdquo; Madams de S&mdash; cried out, with
      sudden vehemence. &ldquo;All the world listens to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know these ladies,&rdquo; said Razumov loudly rising from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying, Kirylo Sidorovitch? I understand that she was
      talking to you here, in the garden, the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in the garden,&rdquo; said Razumov gloomily. Then, with an effort, &ldquo;She
      made herself known to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then ran away from us all,&rdquo; Madame de S&mdash; continued, with
      ghastly vivacity. &ldquo;After coming to the very door! What a peculiar
      proceeding! Well, I have been a shy little provincial girl at one time.
      Yes, Razumov&rdquo; (she fell into this familiarity intentionally, with an
      appalling grimace of graciousness. Razumov gave a perceptible start),
      &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s my origin. A simple provincial family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a marvel,&rdquo; Peter Ivanovich uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was to Razumov that she gave her death&rsquo;s-head smile. Her tone was
      quite imperious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must bring the wild young thing here. She is wanted. I reckon upon
      your success&mdash;mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not a wild young thing,&rdquo; muttered Razumov, in a surly voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;that&rsquo;s all the same. She may be one of these young
      conceited democrats. Do you know what I think? I think she is very much
      like you in character. There is a smouldering fire of scorn in you. You
      are darkly self-sufficient, but I can see your very soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her shiny eyes had a dry, intense stare, which, missing Razumov, gave him
      an absurd notion that she was looking at something which was visible to
      her behind him. He cursed himself for an impressionable fool, and asked
      with forced calmness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you see? Anything resembling me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved her rigidly set face from left to right, negatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some sort of phantom in my image?&rdquo; pursued Razumov slowly. &ldquo;For, I
      suppose, a soul when it is seen is just that. A vain thing. There are
      phantoms of the living as well as of the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tenseness of Madame de S&mdash;&lsquo;s stare had relaxed, and now she
      looked at Razumov in a silence that became disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I myself have had an experience,&rdquo; he stammered out, as if compelled.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a phantom once.&rdquo; The unnaturally red lips moved to frame a
      question harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a dead person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hated him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! It was not a woman, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; repeated Razumov, his eyes looking straight into the eyes of
      Madame de S&mdash;. &ldquo;Why should it have been a woman? And why this
      conclusion? Why should I not have been able to hate a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the idea of hating a woman was new to him. At that
      moment he hated Madame de S&mdash;. But it was not exactly hate. It was
      more like the abhorrence that may be caused by a wooden or plaster figure
      of a repulsive kind. She moved no more than if she were such a figure;
      even her eyes, whose unwinking stare plunged into his own, though shining,
      were lifeless, as though they were as artificial as her teeth. For the
      first time Razumov became aware of a faint perfume, but faint as it was it
      nauseated him exceedingly. Again Peter Ivanovitch tapped him slightly on
      the shoulder. Thereupon he bowed, and was about to turn away when he
      received the unexpected favour of a bony, inanimate hand extended to him,
      with the two words in hoarse French&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed over the skeleton hand and left the room, escorted by the great
      man, who made him go out first. The voice from the sofa cried after them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remain here, <i>Pierre</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, <i>ma chere amie</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he left the room with Razumov, shutting the door behind him. The
      landing was prolonged into a bare corridor, right and left, desolate
      perspectives of white and gold decoration without a strip of carpet. The
      very light, pouring through a large window at the end, seemed dusty; and a
      solitary speck reposing on the balustrade of white marble&mdash;the silk
      top-hat of the great feminist&mdash;asserted itself extremely, black and
      glossy in all that crude whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch escorted the visitor without opening his lips. Even when
      they had reached the head of the stairs Peter Ivanovitch did not break the
      silence. Razumov&rsquo;s impulse to continue down the flight and out of the
      house without as much as a nod abandoned him suddenly. He stopped on the
      first step and leaned his back against the wall. Below him the great hall
      with its chequered floor of black and white seemed absurdly large and like
      some public place where a great power of resonance awaits the provocation
      of footfalls and voices. As if afraid of awakening the loud echoes of that
      empty house, Razumov adopted a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really have no mind to turn into a dilettante spiritualist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch shook his head slightly, very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or spend my time in spiritual ecstasies or sublime meditations upon the
      gospel of feminism,&rdquo; continued Razumov. &ldquo;I made my way here for my share
      of action&mdash;action, most respected Peter Ivanovitch! It was not the
      great European writer who attracted me, here, to this odious town of
      liberty. It was somebody much greater. It was the idea of the chief which
      attracted me. There are starving young men in Russia who believe in you so
      much that it seems the only thing that keeps them alive in their misery.
      Think of that, Peter Ivanovitch! No! But only think of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great man, thus entreated, perfectly motionless and silent, was the
      very image of patient, placid respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t speak of the people. They are brutes,&rdquo; added Razumov,
      in the same subdued but forcible tone. At this, a protesting murmur issued
      from the &ldquo;heroic fugitive&rsquo;s&rdquo; beard. A murmur of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say&mdash;children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Brutes!&rdquo; Razumov insisted bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are sound, they are innocent,&rdquo; the great man pleaded in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as that goes, a brute is sound enough.&rdquo; Razumov raised his voice
      at last. &ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t deny the natural innocence of a brute. But what&rsquo;s
      the use of disputing about names? You just try to give these children the
      power and stature of men and see what they will be like. You just give it
      to them and see.... But never mind. I tell you, Peter Ivanovitch, that
      half a dozen young men do not come together nowadays in a shabby student&rsquo;s
      room without your name being whispered, not as a leader of thought, but as
      a centre of revolutionary energies&mdash;the centre of action. What else
      has drawn me near you, do you think? It is not what all the world knows of
      you, surely. It&rsquo;s precisely what the world at large does not know. I was
      irresistibly drawn-let us say impelled, yes, impelled; or, rather,
      compelled, driven&mdash;driven,&rdquo; repented Razumov loudly, and ceased, as
      if startled by the hollow reverberation of the word &ldquo;driven&rdquo; along two
      bare corridors and in the great empty hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch did not seem startled in the least. The young man could
      not control a dry, uneasy laugh. The great revolutionist remained unmoved
      with an effect of commonplace, homely superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse him,&rdquo; said Razumov to himself, &ldquo;he is waiting behind his spectacles
      for me to give myself away.&rdquo; Then aloud, with a satanic enjoyment of the
      scorn prompting him to play with the greatness of the great man&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Peter Ivanovitch, if you only knew the force which drew&mdash;no,
      which <i>drove</i> me towards you! The irresistible force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not feel any desire to laugh now. This time Peter Ivanovitch moved
      his head sideways, knowingly, as much as to say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; This
      expressive movement was almost imperceptible. Razumov went on in secret
      derision&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these days you have been trying to read me, Peter Ivanovitch. That is
      natural. I have perceived it and I have been frank. Perhaps you may think
      I have not been very expansive? But with a man like you it was not needed;
      it would have looked like an impertinence, perhaps. And besides, we
      Russians are prone to talk too much as a rule. I have always felt that.
      And yet, as a nation, we are dumb. I assure you that I am not likely to
      talk to you so much again&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, still keeping on the lower step, came a little nearer to the
      great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been condescending enough. I quite understood it was to lead me
      on. You must render me the justice that I have not tried to please. I have
      been impelled, compelled, or rather sent&mdash;let us say sent&mdash;towards
      you for a work that no one but myself can do. You would call it a harmless
      delusion: a ridiculous delusion at which you don&rsquo;t even smile. It is
      absurd of me to talk like this, yet some day you shall remember these
      words, I hope. Enough of this. Here I stand before you-confessed! But one
      thing more I must add to complete it: a mere blind tool I can never
      consent to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever acknowledgment Razumov was prepared for, he was not prepared to
      have both his hands seized in the great man&rsquo;s grasp. The swiftness of the
      movement was aggressive enough to startle. The burly feminist could not
      have been quicker had his purpose been to jerk Razumov treacherously up on
      the landing and bundle him behind one of the numerous closed doors near
      by. This idea actually occurred to Razumov; his hands being released after
      a darkly eloquent squeeze, he smiled, with a beating heart, straight at
      the beard and the spectacles hiding that impenetrable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought to himself (it stands confessed in his handwriting), &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      move from here till he either speaks or turns away. This is a duel.&rdquo; Many
      seconds passed without a sign or sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the great man said hurriedly, in subdued tones, as if the
      whole thing had been a stolen, breathless interview. &ldquo;Exactly. Come to see
      us here in a few days. This must be gone into deeply&mdash;deeply, between
      you and me. Quite to the bottom. To the...And, by the by, you must bring
      along Natalia Victorovna&mdash;you know, the Haldin girl....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to take this as my first instruction from you?&rdquo; inquired Razumov
      stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Ivanovitch seemed perplexed by this new attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! h&rsquo;m! You are naturally the proper person&mdash;<i>la personne
      indiquee</i>. Every one shall be wanted presently. Every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent down from the landing over Razumov, who had lowered his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment of action approaches,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov did not look up. He did not move till he heard the door of the
      drawing-room close behind the greatest of feminists returning to his
      painted Egeria. Then he walked down slowly into the hall. The door stood
      open, and the shadow of the house was lying aslant over the greatest part
      of the terrace. While crossing it slowly, he lifted his hat and wiped his
      damp forehead, expelling his breath with force to get rid of the last
      vestiges of the air he had been breathing inside. He looked at the palms
      of his hands, and rubbed them gently against his thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt, bizarre as it may seem, as though another self, an independent
      sharer of his mind, had been able to view his whole person very distinctly
      indeed. &ldquo;This is curious,&rdquo; he thought. After a while he formulated his
      opinion of it in the mental ejaculation: &ldquo;Beastly!&rdquo; This disgust vanished
      before a marked uneasiness. &ldquo;This is an effect of nervous exhaustion,&rdquo; he
      reflected with weary sagacity. &ldquo;How am I to go on day after day if I have
      no more power of resistance&mdash;moral resistance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed the path at the foot of the terrace. &ldquo;Moral resistance, moral
      resistance;&rdquo; he kept on repeating these words mentally. Moral endurance.
      Yes, that was the necessity of the situation. An immense longing to make
      his way out of these grounds and to the other end of the town, of throwing
      himself on his bed and going to sleep for hours, swept everything clean
      out of his mind for a moment. &ldquo;Is it possible that I am but a weak
      creature after all?&rdquo; he asked himself, in sudden alarm. &ldquo;Eh! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a start as if awakened from a dream. He even swayed a little
      before recovering himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You stole away from us quietly to walk about here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady companion stood before him, but how she came there he had not the
      slightest idea. Her folded arms were closely cherishing the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been unconscious as I walked, it&rsquo;s a positive fact,&rdquo; said Razumov
      to himself in wonder. He raised his hat with marked civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sallow woman blushed duskily. She had her invariably scared
      expression, as if somebody had just disclosed to her some terrible news.
      But she held her ground, Razumov noticed, without timidity. &ldquo;She is
      incredibly shabby,&rdquo; he thought. In the sunlight her black costume looked
      greenish, with here and there threadbare patches where the stuff seemed
      decomposed by age into a velvety, black, furry state. Her very hair and
      eyebrows looked shabby. Razumov wondered whether she were sixty years old.
      Her figure, though, was young enough. He observed that she did not appear
      starved, but rather as if she had been fed on unwholesome scraps and
      leavings of plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov smiled amiably and moved out of her way. She turned her head to
      keep her scared eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you have been told in there,&rdquo; she affirmed, without
      preliminaries. Her tone, in contrast with her manner, had an unexpectedly
      assured character which put Razumov at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? You must have heard all sorts of talk on many occasions in
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She varied her phrase, with the same incongruous effect of positiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know to a certainty what you have been told to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Razumov shrugged his shoulders a little. He was about to pass on
      with a bow, when a sudden thought struck him. &ldquo;Yes. To be sure! In your
      confidential position you are aware of many things,&rdquo; he murmured, looking
      at the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      That animal got a momentary convulsive hug from the lady companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything was disclosed to me a long time ago,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; Razumov repeated absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch is an awful despot,&rdquo; she jerked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov went on studying the stripes on the grey fur of the cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An iron will is an integral part of such a temperament. How else could he
      be a leader? And I think that you are mistaken in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You tell me that I am mistaken. But I tell you all
      the same that he cares for no one.&rdquo; She jerked her head up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      bring that girl here. That&rsquo;s what you have been told to do&mdash;to bring
      that girl here. Listen to me; you had better tie a stone round her neck
      and throw her into the lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had a sensation of chill and gloom, as if a heavy cloud had passed
      over the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What have I to do with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have been told to bring Nathalie Haldin here. Am I not right? Of
      course I am right. I was not in the room, but I know. I know Peter
      Ivanovitch sufficiently well. He is a great man. Great men are horrible.
      Well, that&rsquo;s it. Have nothing to do with her. That&rsquo;s the best you can do,
      unless you want her to become like me&mdash;disillusioned! Disillusioned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like you,&rdquo; repeated Razumov, glaring at her face, as devoid of all
      comeliness of feature and complexion as the most miserable beggar is of
      money. He smiled, still feeling chilly: a peculiar sensation which annoyed
      him. &ldquo;Disillusioned as to Peter Ivanovitch! Is that all you have lost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She declared, looking frightened, but with immense conviction, &ldquo;Peter
      Ivanovitch stands for everything.&rdquo; Then she added, in another tone, &ldquo;Keep
      the girl away from this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you absolutely inciting me to disobey Peter Ivanovitch just
      because&mdash;because you are disillusioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to blink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly I saw you for the first time I was comforted. You took your hat
      off to me. You looked as if one could trust you. Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank before Razumov&rsquo;s savage snarl of, &ldquo;I have heard something like
      this before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so confounded that she could do nothing but blink for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your humane manner,&rdquo; she explained plaintively. &ldquo;I have been
      starving for, I won&rsquo;t say kindness, but just for a little civility, for I
      don&rsquo;t know how long. And now you are angry....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, on the contrary,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I am very glad you trust me.
      It&rsquo;s possible that later on I may...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you were to get ill,&rdquo; she interrupted eagerly, &ldquo;or meet some
      bitter trouble, you would find I am not a useless fool. You have only to
      let me know. I will come to you. I will indeed. And I will stick to you.
      Misery and I are old acquaintances&mdash;but this life here is worse than
      starving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused anxiously, then in a voice for the first time sounding really
      timid, she added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or if you were engaged in some dangerous work. Sometimes a humble
      companion&mdash;I would not want to know anything. I would follow you with
      joy. I could carry out orders. I have the courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked attentively at the scared round eyes, at the withered,
      sallow, round cheeks. They were quivering about the corners of the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants to escape from here,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I were to tell you that I am engaged in dangerous work?&rdquo; he
      uttered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed the cat to her threadbare bosom with a breathless exclamation.
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Then not much above a whisper: &ldquo;Under Peter Ivanovitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not under Peter Ivanovitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read admiration in her eyes, and made an effort to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his closed hand with the index raised. &ldquo;Like this finger,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling slightly. But it occurred to Razumov that they might
      have been observed from the house, and he became anxious to be gone. She
      blinked, raising up to him her puckered face, and seemed to beg mutely to
      be told something more, to be given a word of encouragement for her
      starving, grotesque, and pathetic devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we be seen from the house?&rdquo; asked Razumov confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered, without showing the slightest surprise at the question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t, on account of this end of the stables.&rdquo; And she added, with
      an acuteness which surprised Razumov, &ldquo;But anybody looking out of an
      upstairs window would know that you have not passed through the gates
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s likely to spy out of the window?&rdquo; queried Razumov. &ldquo;Peter
      Ivanovitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he trouble his head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He expects somebody this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had lowered her eyelids. Razumov looked at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. You hear everything they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She murmured without any animosity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do the tables and chairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood that the bitterness accumulated in the heart of that
      helpless creature had got into her veins, and, like some subtle poison,
      had decomposed her fidelity to that hateful pair. It was a great piece of
      luck for him, he reflected; because women are seldom venal after the
      manner of men, who can be bought for material considerations. She would be
      a good ally, though it was not likely that she was allowed to hear as much
      as the tables and chairs of the Chateau Borel. That could not be expected.
      But still.... And, at any rate, she could be made to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she looked up her eyes met the fixed stare of Razumov, who began to
      speak at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, dear...but upon my word, I haven&rsquo;t the pleasure of knowing
      your name yet. Isn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she made a movement of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it strange? No one is told my name. No one cares. No one talks to me,
      no one writes to me. My parents don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;m alive. I have no
      use for a name, and I have almost forgotten it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov murmured gravely, &ldquo;Yes, but still...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on much slower, with indifference&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may call me Tekla, then. My poor Andrei called me so. I was devoted
      to him. He lived in wretchedness and suffering, and died in misery. That
      is the lot of all us Russians, nameless Russians. There is nothing else
      for us, and no hope anywhere, unless...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless all these people with names are done away with,&rdquo; she finished,
      blinking and pursing up her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be easier to call you Tekla, as you direct me,&rdquo; said Razumov, &ldquo;if
      you consent to call me Kirylo, when we are talking like this&mdash;quietly&mdash;only
      you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he said to himself, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a being who must be terribly afraid of the
      world, else she would have run away from this situation before.&rdquo; Then he
      reflected that the mere fact of leaving the great man abruptly would make
      her a suspect. She could expect no support or countenance from anyone.
      This revolutionist was not fit for an independent existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved with him a few steps, blinking and nursing the cat with a small
      balancing movement of her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;only you and I. That&rsquo;s how I was with my poor Andrei, only he
      was dying, killed by these official brutes&mdash;while you! You are
      strong. You kill the monsters. You have done a great deed. Peter
      Ivanovitch himself must consider you. Well&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget me&mdash;especially
      if you are going back to work in Russia. I could follow you, carrying
      anything that was wanted&mdash;at a distance, you know. Or I could watch
      for hours at the corner of a street if necessary,&mdash;in wet or snow&mdash;yes,
      I could&mdash;all day long. Or I could write for you dangerous documents,
      lists of names or instructions, so that in case of mischance the
      handwriting could not compromise you. And you need not be afraid if they
      were to catch me. I would know how to keep dumb. We women are not so
      easily daunted by pain. I heard Peter Ivanovitch say it is our blunt
      nerves or something. We can stand it better. And it&rsquo;s true; I would just
      as soon bite my tongue out and throw it at them as not. What&rsquo;s the good of
      speech to me? Who would ever want to hear what I could say? Ever since I
      closed the eyes of my poor Andrei I haven&rsquo;t met a man who seemed to care
      for the sound of my voice. I should never have spoken to you if the very
      first time you appeared here you had not taken notice of me so nicely. I
      could not help speaking of you to that charming dear girl. Oh, the sweet
      creature! And strong! One can see that at once. If you have a heart don&rsquo;t
      let her set her foot in here. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov caught her by the arm. Her emotion at being thus seized manifested
      itself by a short struggle, after which she stood still, not looking at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can tell me,&rdquo; he spoke in her ear, &ldquo;why they&mdash;these people
      in that house there&mdash;are so anxious to get hold of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She freed herself to turn upon him, as if made angry by the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that Peter Ivanovitch must direct, inspire,
      influence? It is the breath of his life. There can never be too many
      disciples. He can&rsquo;t bear thinking of anyone escaping him. And a woman,
      too! There is nothing to be done without women, he says. He has written
      it. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was staring at her passion when she broke off suddenly and
      ran away behind the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, thus left to himself, took the direction of the gate. But on this
      day of many conversations, he discovered that very probably he could not
      leave the grounds without having to hold another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping in view from beyond the lodge appeared the expected visitors of
      Peter Ivanovitch: a small party composed of two men and a woman. They
      noticed him too, immediately, and stopped short as if to consult. But in a
      moment the woman, moving aside, motioned with her arm to the two men, who,
      leaving the drive at once, struck across the large neglected lawn, or
      rather grass-plot, and made directly for the house. The woman remained on
      the path waiting for Razumov&rsquo;s approach. She had recognized him. He, too,
      had recognized her at the first glance. He had been made known to her at
      Zurich, where he had broken his journey while on his way from Dresden.
      They had been much together for the three days of his stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearing the very same costume in which he had seen her first. A
      blouse of crimson silk made her noticeable at a distance. With that she
      wore a short brown skirt and a leather belt. Her complexion was the colour
      of coffee and milk, but very clear; her eyes black and glittering, her
      figure erect. A lot of thick hair, nearly white, was done up loosely under
      a dusty Tyrolese hat of dark cloth, which seemed to have lost some of its
      trimmings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression of her face was grave, intent; so grave that Razumov, after
      approaching her close, felt obliged to smile. She greeted him with a manly
      hand-grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Are you going away?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How is that, Razumov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away because I haven&rsquo;t been asked to stay,&rdquo; Razumov answered,
      returning the pressure of her hand with much less force than she had put
      into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jerked her head sideways like one who understands. Meantime Razumov&rsquo;s
      eyes had strayed after the two men. They were crossing the grass-plot
      obliquely, without haste. The shorter of the two was buttoned up in a
      narrow overcoat of some thin grey material, which came nearly to his
      heels. His companion, much taller and broader, wore a short, close-fitting
      jacket and tight trousers tucked into shabby top-boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, who had sent them out of Razumov&rsquo;s way apparently, spoke in a
      businesslike voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to come rushing from Zurich on purpose to meet the train and take
      these two along here to see Peter Ivanovitch. I&rsquo;ve just managed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! indeed,&rdquo; Razumov said perfunctorily, and very vexed at her staying
      behind to talk to him &ldquo;From Zurich&mdash;yes, of course. And these two,
      they come from....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted, without emphasis&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From quite another direction. From a distance, too. A considerable
      distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov shrugged his shoulders. The two men from a distance, after having
      reached the wall of the terrace, disappeared suddenly at its foot as if
      the earth had opened to swallow them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, they have just come from America.&rdquo; The woman in the crimson
      blouse shrugged her shoulders too a little before making that statement.
      &ldquo;The time is drawing near,&rdquo; she interjected, as if speaking to herself. &ldquo;I
      did not tell them who you were. Yakovlitch would have wanted to embrace
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that he with the wisp of hair hanging from his chin, in the long
      coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed aright. That&rsquo;s Yakovlitch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they could not find their way here from the station without you
      coming on purpose from Zurich to show it to them? Verily, without women we
      can do nothing. So it stands written, and apparently so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of an immense lassitude under his effort to be sarcastic.
      And he could see that she had detected it with those steady, brilliant
      black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Nothing. I&rsquo;ve had a devil of a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited, with her black eyes fixed on his face. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that? You men are so impressionable and self-conscious. One day
      is like another, hard, hard&mdash;and there&rsquo;s an end of it, till the great
      day comes. I came over for a very good reason. They wrote to warn Peter
      Ivanovitch of their arrival. But where from? Only from Cherbourg on a bit
      of ship&rsquo;s notepaper. Anybody could have done that. Yakovlitch has lived
      for years and years in America. I am the only one at hand who had known
      him well in the old days. I knew him very well indeed. So Peter Ivanovitch
      telegraphed, asking me to come. It&rsquo;s natural enough, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to vouch for his identity?&rdquo; inquired Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Something of the kind. Fifteen years of a life like his make changes
      in a man. Lonely, like a crow in a strange country. When I think of
      Yakovlitch before he went to America&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The softness of the low tone caused Razumov to glance at her sideways. She
      sighed; her black eyes were looking away; she had plunged the fingers of
      her right hand deep into the mass of nearly white hair, and stirred them
      there absently. When she withdrew her hand the little hat perched on the
      top of her head remained slightly tilted, with a queer inquisitive effect,
      contrasting strongly with the reminiscent murmur that escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not in our first youth even then. But a man is a child always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov thought suddenly, &ldquo;They have been living together.&rdquo; Then aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you follow him to America?&rdquo; he asked point-blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with a perturbed air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what was going on fifteen years ago? It was a time of
      activity. The Revolution has its history by this time. You are in it and
      yet you don&rsquo;t seem to know it. Yakovlitch went away then on a mission; I
      went back to Russia. It had to be so. Afterwards there was nothing for him
      to come back to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! indeed,&rdquo; muttered Razumov, with affected surprise. &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you trying to insinuate&rdquo; she exclaimed quickly. &ldquo;Well, and what
      then if he did get discouraged a little....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a Yankee, with that goatee hanging from his chin. A regular
      Uncle Sam,&rdquo; growled Razumov. &ldquo;Well, and you? You who went to Russia? You
      did not get discouraged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Yakovlitch is a man who cannot be doubted. He, at any rate,
      is the right sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her black, penetrating gaze remained fixed upon Razumov while she spoke,
      and for a moment afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; Razumov inquired coldly, &ldquo;but does it mean that you, for
      instance, think that I am not the right sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no protest, gave no sign of having heard the question; she
      continued looking at him in a manner which he judged not to be absolutely
      unfriendly. In Zurich when he passed through she had taken him under her
      charge, in a way, and was with him from morning till night during his stay
      of two days. She took him round to see several people. At first she talked
      to him a great deal and rather unreservedly, but always avoiding all
      reference to herself; towards the middle of the second day she fell
      silent, attending him zealously as before, and even seeing him off at the
      railway station, where she pressed his hand firmly through the lowered
      carriage window, and, stepping back without a word, waited till the train
      moved. He had noticed that she was treated with quiet regard. He knew
      nothing of her parentage, nothing of her private history or political
      record; he judged her from his own private point of view, as being a
      distinct danger in his path. &ldquo;Judged&rdquo; is not perhaps the right word. It
      was more of a feeling, the summing up of slight impressions aided by the
      discovery that he could not despise her as he despised all the others. He
      had not expected to see her again so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, decidedly; her expression was not unfriendly. Yet he perceived an
      acceleration in the beat of his heart. The conversation could not be
      abandoned at that point. He went on in accents of scrupulous inquiry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it perhaps because I don&rsquo;t seem to accept blindly every development of
      the general doctrine&mdash;such for instance as the feminism of our great
      Peter Ivanovitch? If that is what makes me suspect, then I can only say I
      would scorn to be a slave even to an idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been looking at him all the time, not as a listener looks at one,
      but as if the words he chose to say were only of secondary interest. When
      he finished she slipped her hand, by a sudden and decided movement, under
      his arm and impelled him gently towards the gate of the grounds. He felt
      her firmness and obeyed the impulsion at once, just as the other two men
      had, a moment before, obeyed unquestioningly the wave of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made a few steps like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Razumov, your ideas are probably all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You may be
      valuable&mdash;very valuable. What&rsquo;s the matter with you is that you don&rsquo;t
      like us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She released him. He met her with a frosty smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I expected then to have love as well as convictions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well what I mean. People have been thinking you not quite
      whole-hearted. I have heard that opinion from one side and another. But I
      have understood you at the end of the first day....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov interrupted her, speaking steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you that your perspicacity is at fault here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What phrases he uses!&rdquo; she exclaimed parenthetically. &ldquo;Ah! Kirylo
      Sidorovitch, you like other men are fastidious, full of self-love and
      afraid of trifles. Moreover, you had no training. What you want is to be
      taken in hand by some woman. I am sorry I am not staying here a few days.
      I am going back to Zurich to-morrow, and shall take Yakovlitch with me
      most likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information relieved Razumov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But, all the same, I don&rsquo;t think you
      understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He breathed more freely; she did not protest, but asked, &ldquo;And how did you
      get on with Peter Ivanovitch? You have seen a good deal of each other. How
      is it between you two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing what answer to make, the young man inclined his head slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips had been parted in expectation. She pressed them together, and
      seemed to reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This had a sound of finality, but she did not leave him. It was impossible
      to guess what she had in her mind. Razumov muttered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not of me that you should have asked that question. In a moment you
      shall see Peter Ivanovitch himself, and the subject will come up
      naturally. He will be curious to know what has delayed you so long in this
      garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt Peter Ivanovitch will have something to say to me. Several
      things. He may even speak of you&mdash;question me. Peter Ivanovitch is
      inclined to trust me generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question you? That&rsquo;s very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, half serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;and what shall I say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You may tell him of your discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;my lack of love for....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s between ourselves,&rdquo; she interrupted, it was hard to say
      whether in jest or earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you want to tell Peter Ivanovitch something in my favour,&rdquo;
       said Razumov, with grim playfulness. &ldquo;Well, then, you can tell him that I
      am very much in earnest about my mission. I mean to succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been given a mission!&rdquo; she exclaimed quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It amounts to that. I have been told to bring about a certain event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mission,&rdquo; she repeated, very grave and interested all at once. &ldquo;What
      sort of mission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in the nature of propaganda work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Far away from here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not very far,&rdquo; said Razumov, restraining a sudden desire to laugh,
      although he did not feel joyous in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well, I am not asking questions. It&rsquo;s
      sufficient that Peter Ivanovitch should know what each of us is doing.
      Everything is bound to come right in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, young man. I just simply believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it to Peter Ivanovitch that you owe that faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer the question, and they stood idle, silent, as if
      reluctant to part with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like a man,&rdquo; she murmured at last. &ldquo;As if it were possible to
      tell how a belief comes to one.&rdquo; Her thin Mephistophelian eyebrows moved a
      little. &ldquo;Truly there are millions of people in Russia who would envy the
      life of dogs in this country. It is a horror and a shame to confess this
      even between ourselves. One must believe for very pity. This can&rsquo;t go on.
      No! It can&rsquo;t go on. For twenty years I have been coming and going, looking
      neither to the left nor to the right.... What are you smiling to yourself
      for? You are only at the beginning. You have begun well, but you just wait
      till you have trodden every particle of yourself under your feet in your
      comings and goings. For that is what it comes to. You&rsquo;ve got to trample
      down every particle of your own feelings; for stop you cannot, you must
      not. I have been young, too&mdash;but perhaps you think that I am
      complaining-eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything of the sort,&rdquo; protested Razumov indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you don&rsquo;t, you dear superior creature. You don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She plunged her fingers into the bunch of hair on the left side, and that
      brusque movement had the effect of setting the Tyrolese hat straight on
      her head. She frowned under it without animosity, in the manner of an
      investigator. Razumov averted his face carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men are all alike. You mistake luck for merit. You do it in good
      faith too! I would not be too hard on you. It&rsquo;s masculine nature. You men
      are ridiculously pitiful in your aptitude to cherish childish illusions
      down to the very grave. There are a lot of us who have been at work for
      fifteen years&mdash;I mean constantly&mdash;trying one way after another,
      underground and above ground, looking neither to the right nor to the
      left! I can talk about it. I have been one of these that never rested....
      There! What&rsquo;s the use of talking.... Look at my grey hairs! And here two
      babies come along&mdash;I mean you and Haldin&mdash;you come along and
      manage to strike a blow at the very first try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name of Haldin falling from the rapid and energetic lips of the
      woman revolutionist, Razumov had the usual brusque consciousness of the
      irrevocable. But in all the months which had passed over his head he had
      become hardened to the experience. The consciousness was no longer
      accompanied by the blank dismay and the blind anger of the early days. He
      had argued himself into new beliefs; and he had made for himself a mental
      atmosphere of gloomy and sardonic reverie, a sort of murky medium through
      which the event appeared like a featureless shadow having vaguely the
      shape of a man; a shape extremely familiar, yet utterly inexpressive,
      except for its air of discreet waiting in the dusk. It was not alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo; the woman revolutionist asked unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo; echoed Razumov, making a painful effort not to turn
      upon her savagely. But he relieved himself by laughing a little while he
      stole a glance at her out of the corners of his eyes. This reception of
      her inquiry disturbed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How like a woman,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;What is the good of concerning yourself
      with his appearance? Whatever it was, he is removed beyond all feminine
      influences now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A frown, making three folds at the root of her nose, accentuated the
      Mephistophelian slant of her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suffer, Razumov,&rdquo; she suggested, in her low, confident voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; Razumov faced the woman fairly. &ldquo;But now I think of it, I
      am not sure that he is beyond the influence of one woman at least; the one
      over there&mdash;Madame de S&mdash;, you know. Formerly the dead were
      allowed to rest, but now it seems they are at the beck and call of a crazy
      old harridan. We revolutionists make wonderful discoveries. It is true
      that they are not exactly our own. We have nothing of our own. But
      couldn&rsquo;t the friend of Peter Ivanovitch satisfy your feminine curiosity?
      Couldn&rsquo;t she conjure him up for you?&rdquo;&mdash;he jested like a man in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her concentrated frowning expression relaxed, and she said, a little
      wearily, &ldquo;Let us hope she will make an effort and conjure up some tea for
      us. But that is by no means certain. I am tired, Razumov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tired! What a confession! Well, there has been tea up there. I had
      some. If you hurry on after Yakovlitch, instead of wasting your time with
      such an unsatisfactory sceptical person as myself, you may find the ghost
      of it&mdash;the cold ghost of it&mdash;still lingering in the temple. But
      as to you being tired I can hardly believe it. We are not supposed to be.
      We mustn&rsquo;t, We can&rsquo;t. The other day I read in some paper or other an
      alarmist article on the tireless activity of the revolutionary parties. It
      impresses the world. It&rsquo;s our prestige.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He flings out continually these flouts and sneers;&rdquo; the woman in the
      crimson blouse spoke as if appealing quietly to a third person, but her
      black eyes never left Razumov&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;And what for, pray? Simply because
      some of his conventional notions are shocked, some of his petty masculine
      standards. You might think he was one of these nervous sensitives that
      come to a bad end. And yet,&rdquo; she went on, after a short, reflective pause
      and changing the mode of her address, &ldquo;and yet I have just learned
      something which makes me think that you are a man of character, Kirylo
      Sidorovitch. Yes! indeed&mdash;you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious positiveness of this assertion startled Razumov. Their eyes
      met. He looked away and, through the bars of the rusty gate, stared at the
      clean, wide road shaded by the leafy trees. An electric tramcar, quite
      empty, ran along the avenue with a metallic rustle. It seemed to him he
      would have given anything to be sitting inside all alone. He was
      inexpressibly weary, weary in every fibre of his body, but he had a reason
      for not being the first to break off the conversation. At any instant, in
      the visionary and criminal babble of revolutionists, some momentous words
      might fall on his ear; from her lips, from anybody&rsquo;s lips. As long as he
      managed to preserve a clear mind and to keep down his irritability there
      was nothing to fear. The only condition of success and safety was
      indomitable will-power, he reminded himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to be on the other side of the bars, as though he were actually
      a prisoner within the grounds of this centre of revolutionary plots, of
      this house of folly, of blindness, of villainy and crime. Silently he
      indulged his wounded spirit in a feeling of immense moral and mental
      remoteness. He did not even smile when he heard her repeat the words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! A strong character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to gaze through the bars like a moody prisoner, not thinking
      of escape, but merely pondering upon the faded memories of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t look out,&rdquo; he mumbled, still looking away, &ldquo;you shall
      certainly miss seeing as much as the mere ghost of that tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not to be shaken off in such a way. As a matter of fact he had not
      expected to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, it will be no great loss. I mean the missing of her tea and
      only the ghost of it at that. As to the lady, you must understand that she
      has her positive uses. See <i>that</i>, Razumov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head at this imperative appeal and saw the woman
      revolutionist making the motions of counting money into the palm of her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is. You see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov uttered a slow &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; and returned to his prisoner-like gazing
      upon the neat and shady road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Material means must be obtained in some way, and this is easier than
      breaking into banks. More certain too. There! I am joking.... What is he
      muttering to himself now?&rdquo; she cried under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My admiration of Peter Ivanovitch&rsquo;s devoted self-sacrifice, that&rsquo;s all.
      It&rsquo;s enough to make one sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you squeamish, masculine creature. Sick! Makes him sick! And what do
      you know of the truth of it? There&rsquo;s no looking into the secrets of the
      heart. Peter Ivanovitch knew her years ago, in his worldly days, when he
      was a young officer in the Guards. It is not for us to judge an inspired
      person. That&rsquo;s where you men have an advantage. You are inspired sometimes
      both in thought and action. I have always admitted that when you <i>are</i>
      inspired, when you manage to throw off your masculine cowardice and
      prudishness you are not to be equalled by us. Only, how seldom.... Whereas
      the silliest woman can always be made of use. And why? Because we have
      passion, unappeasable passion.... I should like to know what he is smiling
      at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not smiling,&rdquo; protested Razumov gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! How is one to call it? You made some sort of face. Yes, I know! You
      men can love here and hate there and desire something or other&mdash;and
      you make a great to-do about it, and you call it passion! Yes! While it
      lasts. But we women are in love with love, and with hate, with these very
      things I tell you, and with desire itself. That&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t be bribed
      off so easily as you men. In life, you see, there is not much choice. You
      have either to rot or to burn. And there is not one of us, painted or
      unpainted, that would not rather burn than rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with energy, but in a matter-of-fact tone. Razumov&rsquo;s attention
      had wandered away on a track of its own&mdash;outside the bars of the gate&mdash;but
      not out of earshot. He stuck his hands into the pockets of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rot or burn! Powerfully stated. Painted or unpainted. Very vigorous.
      Painted or...Do tell me&mdash;she would be infernally jealous of him,
      wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? What? The Baroness? Eleanor Maximovna? Jealous of Peter Ivanovitch?
      Heavens! Are these the questions the man&rsquo;s mind is running on? Such a
      thing is not to be thought of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Can&rsquo;t a wealthy old woman be jealous? Or, are they all pure spirits
      together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what put it into your head to ask such a question?&rdquo; she wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I just asked. Masculine frivolity, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; she retorted at once. &ldquo;It is not the time to be frivolous.
      What are you flinging your very heart against? Or, perhaps, you are only
      playing a part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had felt that woman&rsquo;s observation of him like a physical contact,
      like a hand resting lightly on his shoulder. At that moment he received
      the mysterious impression of her having made up her mind for a closer
      grip. He stiffened himself inwardly to bear it without betraying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Playing a Part,&rdquo; he repeated, presenting to her an unmoved profile. &ldquo;It
      must be done very badly since you see through the assumption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched him, her forehead drawn into perpendicular folds, the thin
      black eyebrows diverging upwards like the antennae of an insect. He added
      hardly audibly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. I am doing it no more than the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is doing it?&rdquo; she snapped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Everybody,&rdquo; he said impatiently. &ldquo;You are a materialist, aren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! My dear soul, I have outlived all that nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must remember the definition of Cabanis: &lsquo;Man is a digestive
      tube.&rsquo; I imagine now....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spit on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? On Cabanis? All right. But you can&rsquo;t ignore the importance of a
      good digestion. The joy of life&mdash;you know the joy of life?&mdash;depends
      on a sound stomach, whereas a bad digestion inclines one to scepticism,
      breeds black fancies and thoughts of death. These are facts ascertained by
      physiologists. Well, I assure you that ever since I came over from Russia
      I have been stuffed with indigestible foreign concoctions of the most
      nauseating kind&mdash;pah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are joking,&rdquo; she murmured incredulously. He assented in a detached
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is all a joke. It&rsquo;s hardly worth while talking to a man like me.
      Yet for that very reason men have been known to take their own life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I think it is worth while talking to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kept her in the corner of his eye. She seemed to be thinking out some
      scathing retort, but ended by only shrugging her shoulders slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shallow talk! I suppose one must pardon this weakness in you,&rdquo; she said,
      putting a special accent on the last word. There was something anxious in
      her indulgent conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov noted the slightest shades in this conversation, which he had not
      expected, for which he was not prepared. That was it. &ldquo;I was not
      prepared,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It has taken me unawares.&rdquo; It seemed to
      him that if he only could allow himself to pant openly like a dog for a
      time this oppression would pass away. &ldquo;I shall never be found prepared,&rdquo;
       he thought, with despair. He laughed a little, saying as lightly as he
      could&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. I don&rsquo;t ask for mercy.&rdquo; Then affecting a playful uneasiness, &ldquo;But
      aren&rsquo;t you afraid Peter Ivanovitch might suspect us of plotting something
      unauthorized together by the gate here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not afraid. You are quite safe from suspicions while you are
      with me, my dear young man.&rdquo; The humorous gleam in her black eyes went
      out. &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch trusts me,&rdquo; she went on, quite austerely. &ldquo;He takes
      my advice. I am his right hand, as it were, in certain most important
      things.... That amuses you what? Do you think I am boasting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid. I was just only saying to myself that Peter Ivanovitch seems
      to have solved the woman question pretty completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke he reproached himself for his words, for his tone. All
      day long he had been saying the wrong things. It was folly, worse than
      folly. It was weakness; it was this disease of perversity overcoming his
      will. Was this the way to meet speeches which certainly contained the
      promise of future confidences from that woman who apparently had a great
      store of secret knowledge and so much influence? Why give her this
      puzzling impression? But she did not seem inimical. There was no anger in
      her voice. It was strangely speculative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One does not know what to think, Razumov. You must have bitten something
      bitter in your cradle.&rdquo; Razumov gave her a sidelong glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Something bitter? That&rsquo;s an explanation,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Only it was
      much later. And don&rsquo;t you think, Sophia Antonovna, that you and I come
      from the same cradle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman, whose name he had forced himself at last to pronounce (he had
      experienced a strong repugnance in letting it pass his lips), the woman
      revolutionist murmured, after a pause&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;Russia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disdained even to nod. She seemed softened, her black eyes very still,
      as though she were pursuing the simile in her thoughts to all its tender
      associations. But suddenly she knitted her brows in a Mephistophelian
      frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Perhaps no wonder, then. Yes. One lies there lapped up in evils,
      watched over by beings that are worse than ogres, ghouls, and vampires.
      They must be driven away, destroyed utterly. In regard of that task
      nothing else matters if men and women are determined and faithful. That&rsquo;s
      how I came to feel in the end. The great thing is not to quarrel amongst
      ourselves about all sorts of conventional trifles. Remember that,
      Razumov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov was not listening. He had even lost the sense of being watched in
      a sort of heavy tranquillity. His uneasiness, his exasperation, his scorn
      were blunted at last by all these trying hours. It seemed to him that now
      they were blunted for ever. &ldquo;I am a match for them all,&rdquo; he thought, with
      a conviction too firm to be exulting. The woman revolutionist had ceased
      speaking; he was not looking at her; there was no one passing along the
      road. He almost forgot that he was not alone. He heard her voice again,
      curt, businesslike, and yet betraying the hesitation which had been the
      real reason of her prolonged silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Razumov!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, whose face was turned away from her, made a grimace like a man
      who hears a false note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me: is it true that on the very morning of the deed you actually
      attended the lectures at the University?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An appreciable fraction of a second elapsed before the real import of the
      question reached him, like a bullet which strikes some time after the
      flash of the fired shot. Luckily his disengaged hand was ready to grip a
      bar of the gate. He held it with a terrible force, but his presence of
      mind was gone. He could make only a sort of gurgling, grumpy sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Kirylo Sidorovitch!&rdquo; she urged him. &ldquo;I know you are not a boastful
      man. <i>That</i> one must say for you. You are a silent man. Too silent,
      perhaps. You are feeding on some bitterness of your own. You are not an
      enthusiast. You are, perhaps, all the stronger for that. But you might
      tell me. One would like to understand you a little more. I was so
      immensely struck.... Have you really done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got his voice back. The shot had missed him. It had been fired at
      random, altogether, more like a signal for coming to close quarters. It
      was to be a plain struggle for self-preservation. And she was a dangerous
      adversary too. But he was ready for battle; he was so ready that when he
      turned towards her not a muscle of his face moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said, without animation, secretly strung up but perfectly
      sure of himself. &ldquo;Lectures&mdash;certainly, But what makes you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was she who was animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had it in a letter, written by a young man in Petersburg; one of us, of
      course. You were seen&mdash;you were observed with your notebook,
      impassible, taking notes....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He enveloped her with his fixed stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call such coolness superb&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. It is a proof of uncommon
      strength of character. The young man writes that nobody could have guessed
      from your face and manner the part you had played only some two hours
      before&mdash;the great, momentous, glorious part....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. Nobody could have guessed,&rdquo; assented Razumov gravely, &ldquo;because,
      don&rsquo;t you see, nobody at that time....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. But all the same you are a man of exceptional fortitude, it
      seems. You looked exactly as usual. It was remembered afterwards with
      wonder....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cost me no effort,&rdquo; Razumov declared, with the same staring gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s almost more wonderful still!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and fell silent
      while Razumov asked himself whether he had not said there something
      utterly unnecessary&mdash;or even worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your intention was to stay in Russia? You had planned....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted Razumov without haste. &ldquo;I had made no plans of any
      sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just simply walked away?&rdquo; she struck in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head in slow assent. &ldquo;Simply&mdash;yes.&rdquo; He had gradually
      released his hold on the bar of the gate, as though he had acquired the
      conviction that no random shot could knock him over now. And suddenly he
      was inspired to add, &ldquo;The snow was coming down very thick, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a slight appreciative movement of the head, like an expert in such
      enterprises, very interested, capable of taking every point
      professionally. Razumov remembered something he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I turned into a narrow side street, you understand,&rdquo; he went on
      negligently, and paused as if it were not worth talking about. Then he
      remembered another detail and dropped it before her, like a disdainful
      dole to her curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt inclined to lie down and go to sleep there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clicked her tongue at that symptom, very struck indeed. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the notebook! The amazing notebook, man. You don&rsquo;t mean to say you
      had put it in your pocket beforehand!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov gave a start. It might have been a sign of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went home. Straight home to my rooms,&rdquo; he said distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coolness of the man! You dared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I assure you I was perfectly calm. Ha! Calmer than I am now
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you much better as you are now than when you indulge that bitter
      vein of yours, Razumov. And nobody in the house saw you return&mdash;eh?
      That might have appeared queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Razumov said firmly. &ldquo;Dvornik, landlady, girl, all out of the
      way. I went up like a shadow. It was a murky morning. The stairs were
      dark. I glided up like a phantom. Fate? Luck? What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just see it!&rdquo; The eyes of the woman revolutionist snapped darkly. &ldquo;Well&mdash;and
      then you considered....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had it all ready in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I looked at my watch, since you want to know. There was just time. I
      took that notebook, and ran down the stairs on tiptoe. Have you ever
      listened to the pit-pat of a man running round and round the shaft of a
      deep staircase? They have a gaslight at the bottom burning night and day.
      I suppose it&rsquo;s gleaming down there now.... The sound dies out&mdash;the
      flame winks....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He noticed the vacillation of surprise passing over the steady curiosity
      of the black eyes fastened on his face as if the woman revolutionist
      received the sound of his voice into her pupils instead of her ears. He
      checked himself, passed his hand over his forehead, confused, like a man
      who has been dreaming aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where could a student be running if not to his lectures in the morning?
      At night it&rsquo;s another matter. I did not care if all the house had been
      there to look at me. But I don&rsquo;t suppose there was anyone. It&rsquo;s best not
      to be seen or heard. Aha! The people that are neither seen nor heard are
      the lucky ones&mdash;in Russia. Don&rsquo;t you admire my luck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Astonishing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you have luck as well as determination, then
      indeed you are likely to turn out an invaluable acquisition for the work
      in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was earnest; and it seemed to Razumov that it was speculative,
      even as though she were already apportioning him, in her mind, his share
      of the work. Her eyes were cast down. He waited, not very alert now, but
      with the grip of the ever-present danger giving him an air of attentive
      gravity. Who could have written about him in that letter from Petersburg?
      A fellow student, surely&mdash;some imbecile victim of revolutionary
      propaganda, some foolish slave of foreign, subversive ideals. A long,
      famine-stricken, red-nosed figure presented itself to his mental search.
      That must have been the fellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled inwardly at the absolute wrong-headedness of the whole thing,
      the self-deception of a criminal idealist shattering his existence like a
      thunder-clap out of a clear sky, and re-echoing amongst the wreckage in
      the false assumptions of those other fools. Fancy that hungry and piteous
      imbecile furnishing to the curiosity of the revolutionist refugees this
      utterly fantastic detail! He appreciated it as by no means constituting a
      danger. On the contrary. As things stood it was for his advantage rather,
      a piece of sinister luck which had only to be accepted with proper
      caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Razumov,&rdquo; he heard the musing voice of the woman, &ldquo;you have not
      the face of a lucky man.&rdquo; She raised her eyes with renewed interest. &ldquo;And
      so that was the way of it. After doing your work you simply walked off and
      made for your rooms. That sort of thing succeeds sometimes. I suppose it
      was agreed beforehand that, once the business over, each of you would go
      his own way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov preserved the seriousness of his expression and the deliberate, if
      cautious, manner of speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was not that the best thing to do?&rdquo; he asked, in a dispassionate tone.
      &ldquo;And anyway,&rdquo; he added, after waiting a moment, &ldquo;we did not give much
      thought to what would come after. We never discussed formally any line of
      conduct. It was understood, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She approved his statement with slight nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, of course, wished to remain in Russia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In St. Petersburg itself,&rdquo; emphasized Razumov. &ldquo;It was the only safe
      course for me. And, moreover, I had nowhere else to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Yes! I know. Clearly. And the other&mdash;this wonderful Haldin
      appearing only to be regretted&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what he intended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had foreseen that such a question would certainly come to meet him
      sooner or later. He raised his hands a little and let them fall helplessly
      by his side&mdash;nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the white-haired woman conspirator who was the first to break the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very curious,&rdquo; she pronounced slowly. &ldquo;And you did not think, Kirylo
      Sidorovitch, that he might perhaps wish to get in touch with you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov discovered that he could not suppress the trembling of his lips.
      But he thought that he owed it to himself to speak. A negative sign would
      not do again. Speak he must, if only to get at the bottom of what that St.
      Petersburg letter might have contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stayed at home next day,&rdquo; he said, bending down a little and plunging
      his glance into the black eyes of the woman so that she should not observe
      the trembling of his lips. &ldquo;Yes, I stayed at home. As my actions are
      remembered and written about, then perhaps you are aware that I was <i>not</i>
      seen at the lectures next day. Eh? You didn&rsquo;t know? Well, I stopped at
      home-the live-long day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if moved by his agitated tone, she murmured a sympathetic &ldquo;I see! It
      must have been trying enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to understand one&rsquo;s feelings,&rdquo; said Razumov steadily. &ldquo;It was
      trying. It was horrible; it was an atrocious day. It was not the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand. Afterwards, when you heard they had got him. Don&rsquo;t I
      know how one feels after losing a comrade in the good fight? One&rsquo;s ashamed
      of being left. And I can remember so many. Never mind. They shall be
      avenged before long. And what is death? At any rate, it is not a shameful
      thing like some kinds of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov felt something stir in his breast, a sort of feeble and unpleasant
      tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some kinds of life?&rdquo; he repeated, looking at her searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The subservient, submissive life. Life? No! Vegetation on the filthy heap
      of iniquity which the world is. Life, Razumov, not to be vile must be a
      revolt&mdash;a pitiless protest&mdash;all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She calmed down, the gleam of suffused tears in her eyes dried out
      instantly by the heat of her passion, and it was in her capable,
      businesslike manner that she went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand me, Razumov. You are not an enthusiast, but there is an
      immense force of revolt in you. I felt it from the first, directly I set
      my eyes on you&mdash;you remember&mdash;in Zurich. Oh! You are full of
      bitter revolt. That is good. Indignation flags sometimes, revenge itself
      may become a weariness, but that uncompromising sense of necessity and
      justice which armed your and Haldin&rsquo;s hands to strike down that fanatical
      brute...for it was that&mdash;nothing but that! I have been thinking it
      out. It could have been nothing else but that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov made a slight bow, the irony of which was concealed by an almost
      sinister immobility of feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak for the dead. As for myself, I can assure you that my
      conduct was dictated by necessity and by the sense of&mdash;well&mdash;retributive
      justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, that,&rdquo; he said to himself, while her eyes rested upon him, black
      and impenetrable like the mental caverns where revolutionary thought
      should sit plotting the violent way of its dream of changes. As if
      anything could be changed! In this world of men nothing can be changed&mdash;neither
      happiness nor misery. They can only be displaced at the cost of corrupted
      consciences and broken lives&mdash;a futile game for arrogant philosophers
      and sanguinary triflers. Those thoughts darted through Razumov&rsquo;s head
      while he stood facing the old revolutionary hand, the respected, trusted,
      and influential Sophia Antonovna, whose word had such a weight in the
      &ldquo;active&rdquo; section of every party. She was much more representative than the
      great Peter Ivanovitch. Stripped of rhetoric, mysticism, and theories, she
      was the true spirit of destructive revolution. And she was the personal
      adversary he had to meet. It gave him a feeling of triumphant pleasure to
      deceive her out of her own mouth. The epigrammatic saying that speech has
      been given to us for the purpose of concealing our thoughts came into his
      mind. Of that cynical theory this was a very subtle and a very scornful
      application, flouting in its own words the very spirit of ruthless
      revolution, embodied in that woman with her white hair and black eyebrows,
      like slightly sinuous lines of Indian ink, drawn together by the
      perpendicular folds of a thoughtful frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Retributive. No pity!&rdquo; was the conclusion of her silence. And
      this once broken, she went on impulsively in short, vibrating sentences&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to my story, Razumov!...&rdquo; Her father was a clever but unlucky
      artisan. No joy had lighted up his laborious days. He died at fifty; all
      the years of his life he had panted under the thumb of masters whose
      rapacity exacted from him the price of the water, of the salt, of the very
      air he breathed; taxed the sweat of his brow and claimed the blood of his
      sons. No protection, no guidance! What had society to say to him? Be
      submissive and be honest. If you rebel I shall kill you. If you steal I
      shall imprison you. But if you suffer I have nothing for you&mdash;nothing
      except perhaps a beggarly dole of bread&mdash;but no consolation for your
      trouble, no respect for your manhood, no pity for the sorrows of your
      miserable life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he laboured, he suffered, and he died. He died in the hospital.
      Standing by the common grave she thought of his tormented existence&mdash;she
      saw it whole. She reckoned the simple joys of life, the birthright of the
      humblest, of which his gentle heart had been robbed by the crime of a
      society which nothing can absolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Razumov,&rdquo; she continued, in an impressive, lowered voice, &ldquo;it was
      like a lurid light in which I stood, still almost a child, and cursed not
      the toil, not the misery which had been his lot, but the great social
      iniquity of the system resting on unrequited toil and unpitied sufferings.
      From that moment I was a revolutionist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, trying to raise himself above the dangerous weaknesses of
      contempt or compassion, had preserved an impassive countenance. She, with
      an unaffected touch of mere bitterness, the first he could notice since he
      had come in contact with the woman, went on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I could not go to the Church where the priests of the system exhorted
      such unconsidered vermin as I to resignation, I went to the secret
      societies as soon as I knew how to find my way. I was sixteen years old&mdash;no
      more, Razumov! And&mdash;look at my white hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In these last words there was neither pride nor sadness. The bitterness
      too was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a lot of it. I had always magnificent hair, even as a chit of a
      girl. Only, at that time we were cutting it short and thinking that there
      was the first step towards crushing the social infamy. Crush the Infamy! A
      fine watchword! I would placard it on the walls of prisons and palaces,
      carve it on hard rocks, hang it out in letters of fire on that empty sky
      for a sign of hope and terror&mdash;a portent of the end....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are eloquent, Sophia Antonovna,&rdquo; Razumov interrupted suddenly. &ldquo;Only,
      so far you seem to have been writing it in water....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was checked but not offended. &ldquo;Who knows? Very soon it may become a
      fact written all over that great land of ours,&rdquo; she hinted meaningly. &ldquo;And
      then one would have lived long enough. White hair won&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked at her white hair: and this mark of so many uneasy years
      seemed nothing but a testimony to the invincible vigour of revolt. It
      threw out into an astonishing relief the unwrinkled face, the brilliant
      black glance, the upright compact figure, the simple, brisk
      self-possession of the mature personality&mdash;as though in her
      revolutionary pilgrimage she had discovered the secret, not of everlasting
      youth, but of everlasting endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      How un-Russian she looked, thought Razumov. Her mother might have been a
      Jewess or an Armenian or devil knew what. He reflected that a
      revolutionist is seldom true to the settled type. All revolt is the
      expression of strong individualism&mdash;ran his thought vaguely. One can
      tell them a mile off in any society, in any surroundings. It was
      astonishing that the police....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not meet again very soon, I think,&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;I am
      leaving to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Zurich?&rdquo; Razumov asked casually, but feeling relieved, not from any
      distinct apprehension, but from a feeling of stress as if after a
      wrestling match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Zurich&mdash;and farther on, perhaps, much farther. Another journey.
      When I think of all my journeys! The last must come some day. Never mind,
      Razumov. We had to have a good long talk. I would have certainly tried to
      see you if we had not met. Peter Ivanovitch knows where you live? Yes. I
      meant to have asked him&mdash;but it&rsquo;s better like this. You see, we
      expect two more men; and I had much rather wait here talking with you than
      up there at the house with....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having cast a glance beyond the gate, she interrupted herself. &ldquo;Here they
      are,&rdquo; she said rapidly. &ldquo;Well, Kirylo Sidorovitch, we shall have to say
      good-bye, presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      In his incertitude of the ground on which he stood Razumov felt perturbed.
      Turning his head quickly, he saw two men on the opposite side of the road.
      Seeing themselves noticed by Sophia Antonovna, they crossed over at once,
      and passed one after another through the little gate by the side of the
      empty lodge. They looked hard at the stranger, but without mistrust, the
      crimson blouse being a flaring safety signal. The first, great white
      hairless face, double chin, prominent stomach, which he seemed to carry
      forward consciously within a strongly distended overcoat, only nodded and
      averted his eyes peevishly; his companion&mdash;lean, flushed cheekbones,
      a military red moustache below a sharp, salient nose&mdash;approached at
      once Sophia Antonovna, greeting her warmly. His voice was very strong but
      inarticulate. It sounded like a deep buzzing. The woman revolutionist was
      quietly cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Razumov,&rdquo; she announced in a clear voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lean new-comer made an eager half-turn. &ldquo;He will want to embrace me,&rdquo;
       thought our young man with a deep recoil of all his being, while his limbs
      seemed too heavy to move. But it was a groundless alarm. He had to do now
      with a generation of conspirators who did not kiss each other on both
      cheeks; and raising an arm that felt like lead he dropped his hand into a
      largely-outstretched palm, fleshless and hot as if dried up by fever,
      giving a bony pressure, expressive, seeming to say, &ldquo;Between us there&rsquo;s no
      need of words.&rdquo; The man had big, wide-open eyes. Razumov fancied he could
      see a smile behind their sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Razumov,&rdquo; Sophia Antonovna repeated loudly for the benefit of the
      fat man, who at some distance displayed the profile of his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one moved. Everything, sounds, attitudes, movements, and immobility
      seemed to be part of an experiment, the result of which was a thin voice
      piping with comic peevishness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! Razumov. We have been hearing of nothing but Mr. Razumov for
      months. For my part, I confess I would rather have seen Haldin on this
      spot instead of Mr. Razumov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squeaky stress put on the name &ldquo;Razumov&mdash;Mr. Razumov&rdquo; pierced the
      ear ridiculously, like the falsetto of a circus clown beginning an
      elaborate joke. Astonishment was Razumov&rsquo;s first response, followed by
      sudden indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; he asked in a stern tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! Silliness. He&rsquo;s always like that.&rdquo; Sophia Antonovna was obviously
      vexed. But she dropped the information, &ldquo;Necator,&rdquo; from her lips just loud
      enough to be heard by Razumov. The abrupt squeaks of the fat man seemed to
      proceed from that thing like a balloon he carried under his overcoat. The
      stolidity of his attitude, the big feet, the lifeless, hanging hands, the
      enormous bloodless cheek, the thin wisps of hair straggling down the fat
      nape of the neck, fascinated Razumov into a stare on the verge of horror
      and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikita, surnamed Necator, with a sinister aptness of alliteration! Razumov
      had heard of him. He had heard so much since crossing the frontier of
      these celebrities of the militant revolution; the legends, the stories,
      the authentic chronicle, which now and then peeps out before a
      half-incredulous world. Razumov had heard of him. He was supposed to have
      killed more, gendarmes and police agents than any revolutionist living. He
      had been entrusted with executions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper with the letters N.N., the very pseudonym of murder, found
      pinned on the stabbed breast of a certain notorious spy (this picturesque
      detail of a sensational murder case had got into the newspapers), was the
      mark of his handiwork. &ldquo;By order of the Committee.&mdash;N.N.&rdquo; A corner of
      the curtain lifted to strike the imagination of the gaping world. He was
      said to have been innumerable times in and out of Russia, the Necator of
      bureaucrats, of provincial governors, of obscure informers. He lived
      between whiles, Razumov had heard, on the shores of the Lake of Como, with
      a charming wife, devoted to the cause, and two young children. But how
      could that creature, so grotesque as to set town dogs barking at its mere
      sight, go about on those deadly errands and slip through the meshes of the
      police?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now? what now?&rdquo; the voice squeaked. &ldquo;I am only sincere. It&rsquo;s not
      denied that the other was the leading spirit. Well, it would have been
      better if he had been the one spared to us. More useful. I am not a
      sentimentalist. Say what I think...only natural.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Squeak, squeak, squeak, without a gesture, without a stir&mdash;the
      horrible squeaky burlesque of professional jealousy&mdash;this man of a
      sinister alliterative nickname, this executioner of revolutionary
      verdicts, the terrifying N.N. exasperated like a fashionable tenor by the
      attention attracted to the performance of an obscure amateur. Sophia
      Antonovna shrugged her shoulders. The comrade with the martial red
      moustache hurried towards Razumov full of conciliatory intentions in his
      strong buzzing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil take it! And in this place, too, in the public street, so to speak.
      But you can see yourself how it is. One of his fantastic sallies.
      Absolutely of no consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t concern yourself,&rdquo; cried Razumov, going off into a long fit of
      laughter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other, his hectic flush like a pair of burns on his cheek-bones,
      stared for a moment and burst out laughing too. Razumov, whose hilarity
      died out all at once, made a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough of this,&rdquo; he began in a clear, incisive voice, though he could
      hardly control the trembling of his legs. &ldquo;I will have no more of it. I
      shall not permit anyone.... I can see very well what you are at with those
      allusions.... Inquire, investigate! I defy you, but I will not be played
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken such words before. He had been driven to cry them out in the
      face of other suspicions. It was an infernal cycle bringing round that
      protest like a fatal necessity of his existence. But it was no use. He
      would be always played with. Luckily life does not last for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo; he shouted, striking his fist into the palm of his
      other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirylo Sidorovitch&mdash;what has come to you?&rdquo; The woman revolutionist
      interfered with authority. They were all looking at Razumov now; the
      slayer of spies and gendarmes had turned about, presenting his enormous
      stomach in full, like a shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shout. There are people passing.&rdquo; Sophia Antonovna was apprehensive
      of another outburst. A steam-launch from Monrepos had come to the
      landing-stage opposite the gate, its hoarse whistle and the churning noise
      alongside all unnoticed, had landed a small bunch of local passengers who
      were dispersing their several ways. Only a specimen of early tourist in
      knickerbockers, conspicuous by a brand-new yellow leather glass-case, hung
      about for a moment, scenting something unusual about these four people
      within the rusty iron gates of what looked the grounds run wild of an
      unoccupied private house. Ah! If he had only known what the chance of
      commonplace travelling had suddenly put in his way! But he was a well-bred
      person; he averted his gaze and moved off with short steps along the
      avenue, on the watch for a tramcar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gesture from Sophia Antonovna, &ldquo;Leave him to me,&rdquo; had sent the two men
      away&mdash;the buzzing of the inarticulate voice growing fainter and
      fainter, and the thin pipe of &ldquo;What now? what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; reduced to
      the proportions of a squeaking toy by the distance. They had left him to
      her. So many things could be left safely to the experience of Sophia
      Antonovna. And at once, her black eyes turned to Razumov, her mind tried
      to get at the heart of that outburst. It had some meaning. No one is born
      an active revolutionist. The change comes disturbingly, with the force of
      a sudden vocation, bringing in its train agonizing doubts, assertive
      violences, an unstable state of the soul, till the final appeasement of
      the convert in the perfect fierceness of conviction. She had seen&mdash;often
      had only divined&mdash;scores of these young men and young women going
      through an emotional crisis. This young man looked like a moody egotist.
      And besides, it was a special&mdash;a unique case. She had never met an
      individuality which interested and puzzled her so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Razumov, my good friend. If you carry on like this you will go
      mad. You are angry with everybody and bitter with yourself, and on the
      look out for something to torment yourself with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s intolerable!&rdquo; Razumov could only speak in gasps. &ldquo;You must admit
      that I can have no illusions on the attitude which...it isn&rsquo;t clear...or
      rather only too clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of despair. It was not his courage that failed him. The
      choking fumes of falsehood had taken him by the throat&mdash;the thought
      of being condemned to struggle on and on in that tainted atmosphere
      without the hope of ever renewing his strength by a breath of fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A glass of cold water is what you want.&rdquo; Sophia Antonovna glanced up the
      grounds at the house and shook her head, then out of the gate at the
      brimful placidity of the lake. With a half-comical shrug of the shoulders,
      she gave the remedy up in the face of that abundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you, my dear soul, who are flinging yourself at something which
      does not exist. What is it? Self-reproach, or what? It&rsquo;s absurd. You
      couldn&rsquo;t have gone and given yourself up because your comrade was taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remonstrated with him reasonably, at some length too. He had nothing
      to complain of in his reception. Every new-comer was discussed more or
      less. Everybody had to be thoroughly understood before being accepted. No
      one that she could remember had been shown from the first so much
      confidence. Soon, very soon, perhaps sooner than he expected, he would be
      given an opportunity of showing his devotion to the sacred task of
      crushing the Infamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, listening quietly, thought: &ldquo;It may be that she is trying to lull
      my suspicions to sleep. On the other hand, it is obvious that most of them
      are fools.&rdquo; He moved aside a couple of paces and, folding his arms on his
      breast, leaned back against the stone pillar of the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to what remains obscure in the fate of that poor Haldin,&rdquo; Sophia
      Antonovna dropped into a slowness of utterance which was to Razumov like
      the falling of molten lead drop by drop; &ldquo;as to that&mdash;though no one
      ever hinted that either from fear or neglect your conduct has not been
      what it should have been&mdash;well, I have a bit of intelligence....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov could not prevent himself from raising his head, and Sophia
      Antonovna nodded slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. You remember that letter from St. Petersburg I mentioned to you a
      moment ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter? Perfectly. Some busybody has been reporting my conduct on a
      certain day. It&rsquo;s rather sickening. I suppose our police are greatly
      edified when they open these interesting and&mdash;and&mdash;superfluous
      letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear no! The police do not get hold of our letters as easily as you
      imagine. The letter in question did not leave St. Petersburg till the ice
      broke up. It went by the first English steamer which left the Neva this
      spring. They have a fireman on board&mdash;one of us, in fact. It has
      reached me from Hull....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused as if she were surprised at the sullen fixity of Razumov&rsquo;s
      gaze, but went on at once, and much faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have some of our people there who...but never mind. The writer of the
      letter relates an incident which he thinks may possibly be connected with
      Haldin&rsquo;s arrest. I was just going to tell you when those two men came
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That also was an incident,&rdquo; muttered Razumov, &ldquo;of a very charming kind&mdash;for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave off that!&rdquo; cried Sophia Antonovna. &ldquo;Nobody cares for Nikita&rsquo;s
      barking. There&rsquo;s no malice in him. Listen to what I have to say. You may
      be able to throw a light. There was in St. Petersburg a sort of town
      peasant&mdash;a man who owned horses. He came to town years ago to work
      for some relation as a driver and ended by owning a cab or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She might well have spared herself the slight effort of the gesture:
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Razumov did not mean to speak; he could not have interrupted her
      now, not to save his life. The contraction of his facial muscles had been
      involuntary, a mere surface stir, leaving him sullenly attentive as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not a quite ordinary man of his class&mdash;it seems,&rdquo; she went
      on. &ldquo;The people of the house&mdash;my informant talked with many of them&mdash;you
      know, one of those enormous houses of shame and misery....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna need not have enlarged on the character of the house.
      Razumov saw clearly, towering at her back, a dark mass of masonry veiled
      in snowflakes, with the long row of windows of the eating-shop shining
      greasily very near the ground. The ghost of that night pursued him. He
      stood up to it with rage and with weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the late Haldin ever by chance speak to you of that house?&rdquo; Sophia
      Antonovna was anxious to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Razumov, making that answer, wondered whether he were falling into
      a trap. It was so humiliating to lie to these people that he probably
      could not have said no. &ldquo;He mentioned to me once,&rdquo; he added, as if making
      an effort of memory, &ldquo;a house of that sort. He used to visit some workmen
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna triumphed. Her correspondent had discovered that fact
      quite accidentally from the talk of the people of the house, having made
      friends with a workman who occupied a room there. They described Haldin&rsquo;s
      appearance perfectly. He brought comforting words of hope into their
      misery. He came irregularly, but he came very often, and&mdash;her
      correspondent wrote&mdash;sometimes he spent a night in the house,
      sleeping, they thought, in a stable which opened upon the inner yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Note that, Razumov! In a stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov had listened with a sort of ferocious but amused acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. In the straw. It was probably the cleanest spot in the whole house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; assented the woman with that deep frown which seemed to draw
      closer together her black eyes in a sinister fashion. No four-footed beast
      could stand the filth and wretchedness so many human beings were condemned
      to suffer from in Russia. The point of this discovery was that it proved
      Haldin to have been familiar with that horse-owning peasant&mdash;a
      reckless, independent, free-living fellow not much liked by the other
      inhabitants of the house. He was believed to have been the associate of a
      band of housebreakers. Some of these got captured. Not while he was
      driving them, however; but still there was a suspicion against the fellow
      of having given a hint to the police and...
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman revolutionist checked herself suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you? Have you ever heard your friend refer to a certain Ziemianitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov was ready for the name. He had been looking out for the question.
      &ldquo;When it comes I shall own up,&rdquo; he had said to himself. But he took his
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; he began slowly. &ldquo;Ziemianitch, a peasant owning a team of
      horses. Yes. On one occasion. Ziemianitch! Certainly! Ziemianitch of the
      horses.... How could it have slipped my memory like this? One of the last
      conversations we had together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means,&rdquo;&mdash;Sophia Antonovna looked very grave,&mdash;&ldquo;that means,
      Razumov, it was very shortly before&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before what?&rdquo; shouted Razumov, advancing at the woman, who looked
      astonished but stood her ground. &ldquo;Before.... Oh! Of course, it was before!
      How could it have been after? Only a few hours before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he spoke of him favourably?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With enthusiasm! The horses of Ziemianitch! The free soul of
      Ziemianitch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov took a savage delight in the loud utterance of that name, which
      had never before crossed his lips audibly. He fixed his blazing eyes on
      the woman till at last her fascinated expression recalled him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The late Haldin,&rdquo; he said, holding himself in, with downcast eyes, &ldquo;was
      inclined to take sudden fancies to people, on&mdash;on&mdash;what shall I
      say&mdash;insufficient grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; Sophia Antonovna clapped her hands. &ldquo;That, to my mind, settles
      it. The suspicions of my correspondent were aroused....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! Your correspondent,&rdquo; Razumov said in an almost openly mocking tone.
      &ldquo;What suspicions? How aroused? By this Ziemianitch? Probably some drunken,
      gabbling, plausible...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as if you had known him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I knew Haldin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna nodded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Every word you say confirms to my mind the suspicion communicated
      to me in that very interesting letter. This Ziemianitch was found one
      morning hanging from a hook in the stable&mdash;dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov felt a profound trouble. It was visible, because Sophia Antonovna
      was moved to observe vivaciously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! You begin to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw it clearly enough&mdash;in the light of a lantern casting spokes of
      shadow in a cellar-like stable, the body in a sheepskin coat and long
      boots hanging against the wall. A pointed hood, with the ends wound about
      up to the eyes, hid the face. &ldquo;But that does not concern me,&rdquo; he
      reflected. &ldquo;It does not affect my position at all. He never knew who had
      thrashed him. He could not have known.&rdquo; Razumov felt sorry for the old
      lover of the bottle and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Some of them end like that,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What is your idea, Sophia
      Antonovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was really the idea of her correspondent, but Sophia Antonovna had
      adopted it fully. She stated it in one word&mdash;&ldquo;Remorse.&rdquo; Razumov
      opened his eyes very wide at that. Sophia Antonovna&rsquo;s informant, by
      listening to the talk of the house, by putting this and that together, had
      managed to come very near to the truth of Haldin&rsquo;s relation to
      Ziemianitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I who can tell you what you were not certain of&mdash;that your
      friend had some plan for saving himself afterwards, for getting out of St.
      Petersburg, at any rate. Perhaps that and no more, trusting to luck for
      the rest. And that fellow&rsquo;s horses were part of the plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have actually got at the truth,&rdquo; Razumov marvelled to himself, while
      he nodded judicially. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s possible, very possible.&rdquo; But the woman
      revolutionist was very positive that it was so. First of all, a
      conversation about horses between Haldin and Ziemianitch had been partly
      overheard. Then there were the suspicions of the people in the house when
      their &ldquo;young gentleman&rdquo; (they did not know Haldin by his name) ceased to
      call at the house. Some of them used to charge Ziemianitch with knowing
      something of this absence. He denied it with exasperation; but the fact
      was that ever since Haldin&rsquo;s disappearance he was not himself, growing
      moody and thin. Finally, during a quarrel with some woman (to whom he was
      making up), in which most of the inmates of the house took part
      apparently, he was openly abused by his chief enemy, an athletic pedlar,
      for an informer, and for having driven &ldquo;our young gentleman to Siberia,
      the same as you did those young fellows who broke into houses.&rdquo; In
      consequence of this there was a fight, and Ziemianitch got flung down a
      flight of stairs. Thereupon he drank and moped for a week, and then hanged
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna drew her conclusions from the tale. She charged
      Ziemianitch either with drunken indiscretion as to a driving job on a
      certain date, overheard by some spy in some low grog-shop&mdash;perhaps in
      the very eating-shop on the ground floor of the house&mdash;or, maybe, a
      downright denunciation, followed by remorse. A man like that would be
      capable of anything. People said he was a flighty old chap. And if he had
      been once before mixed up with the police&mdash;as seemed certain, though
      he always denied it&mdash;in connexion with these thieves, he would be
      sure to be acquainted with some police underlings, always on the look out
      for something to report. Possibly at first his tale was not made anything
      of till the day that scoundrel de P&mdash;- got his deserts. Ah! But then
      every bit and scrap of hint and information would be acted on, and fatally
      they were bound to get Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna spread out her hands&mdash;&ldquo;Fatally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fatality&mdash;chance! Razumov meditated in silent astonishment upon the
      queer verisimilitude of these inferences. They were obviously to his
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is right now to make this conclusive evidence known generally.&rdquo; Sophia
      Antonovna was very calm and deliberate again. She had received the letter
      three days ago, but did not write at once to Peter Ivanovitch. She knew
      then that she would have the opportunity presently of meeting several men
      of action assembled for an important purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it would be more effective if I could show the letter itself at
      large. I have it in my pocket now. You understand how pleased I was to
      come upon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov was saying to himself, &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t offer to show the letter to me.
      Not likely. Has she told me everything that correspondent of hers has
      found out?&rdquo; He longed to see the letter, but he felt he must not ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, please, was this an investigation ordered, as it were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;There you are again with your sensitiveness. It
      makes you stupid. Don&rsquo;t you see, there was no starting-point for an
      investigation even if any one had thought of it. A perfect blank! That&rsquo;s
      exactly what some people were pointing out as the reason for receiving you
      cautiously. It was all perfectly accidental, arising from my informant
      striking an acquaintance with an intelligent skindresser lodging in that
      particular slum-house. A wonderful coincidence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pious person,&rdquo; suggested Razumov, with a pale smile, &ldquo;would say that
      the hand of God has done it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor father would have said that.&rdquo; Sophia Antonovna did not smile. She
      dropped her eyes. &ldquo;Not that his God ever helped him. It&rsquo;s a long time
      since God has done anything for the people. Anyway, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this would be quite final,&rdquo; said Razumov, with every appearance of
      reflective impartiality, &ldquo;if there was any certitude that the &lsquo;our young
      gentleman&rsquo; of these people was Victor Haldin. Have we got that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s no mistake. My correspondent was as familiar with Haldin&rsquo;s
      personal appearance as with your own,&rdquo; the woman affirmed decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the red-nosed fellow beyond a doubt,&rdquo; Razumov said to himself, with
      reawakened uneasiness. Had his own visit to that accursed house passed
      unnoticed? It was barely possible. Yet it was hardly probable. It was just
      the right sort of food for the popular gossip that gaunt busybody had been
      picking up. But the letter did not seem to contain any allusion to that.
      Unless she had suppressed it. And, if so, why? If it had really escaped
      the prying of that hunger-stricken democrat with a confounded genius for
      recognizing people from description, it could only be for a time. He would
      come upon it presently and hasten to write another letter&mdash;and then!
    </p>
    <p>
      For all the envenomed recklessness of his temper, fed on hate and disdain,
      Razumov shuddered inwardly. It guarded him from common fear, but it could
      not defend him from disgust at being dealt with in any way by these
      people. It was a sort of superstitious dread. Now, since his position had
      been made more secure by their own folly at the cost of Ziemianitch, he
      felt the need of perfect safety, with its freedom from direct lying, with
      its power of moving amongst them silent, unquestioning, listening,
      impenetrable, like the very fate of their crimes and their folly. Was this
      advantage his already? Or not yet? Or never would be?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sophia Antonovna,&rdquo; his air of reluctant concession was genuine in
      so far that he was really loath to part with her without testing her
      sincerity by a question it was impossible to bring about in any way;
      &ldquo;well, Sophia Antonovna, if that is so, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The creature has done justice to himself,&rdquo; the woman observed, as if
      thinking aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Ah yes! Remorse,&rdquo; Razumov muttered, with equivocal contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be harsh, Kirylo Sidorovitch, if you have lost a friend.&rdquo; There was
      no hint of softness in her tone, only the black glitter of her eyes seemed
      detached for an instant from vengeful visions. &ldquo;He was a man of the
      people. The simple Russian soul is never wholly impenitent. It&rsquo;s something
      to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consoling?&rdquo; insinuated Razumov, in a tone of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave off railing,&rdquo; she checked him explosively. &ldquo;Remember, Razumov, that
      women, children, and revolutionists hate irony, which is the negation of
      all saving instincts, of all faith, of all devotion, of all action. Don&rsquo;t
      rail! Leave off.... I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but there are moments when you
      are abhorrent to me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She averted her face. A languid silence, as if all the electricity of the
      situation had been discharged in this flash of passion, lasted for some
      time. Razumov had not flinched. Suddenly she laid the tips of her fingers
      on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was proud to feel that she could read nothing on his face. He was
      really mollified, relieved, if only for a moment, from an obscure
      oppression. And suddenly he asked himself, &ldquo;Why the devil did I go to that
      house? It was an imbecile thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A profound disgust came over him. Sophia Antonovna lingered, talking in a
      friendly manner with an evident conciliatory intention. And it was still
      about the famous letter, referring to various minute details given by her
      informant, who had never seen Ziemianitch. The &ldquo;victim of remorse&rdquo; had
      been buried several weeks before her correspondent began frequenting the
      house. It&mdash;the house&mdash;contained very good revolutionary
      material. The spirit of the heroic Haldin had passed through these dens of
      black wretchedness with a promise of universal redemption from all the
      miseries that oppress mankind. Razumov listened without hearing, gnawed by
      the newborn desire of safety with its independence from that degrading
      method of direct lying which at times he found it almost impossible to
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. The point he wanted to hear about could never come into this
      conversation. There was no way of bringing it forward. He regretted not
      having composed a perfect story for use abroad, in which his fatal
      connexion with the house might have been owned up to. But when he left
      Russia he did not know that Ziemianitch had hanged himself. And, anyway,
      who could have foreseen this woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;informant&rdquo; stumbling upon that
      particular slum, of all the slums awaiting destruction in the purifying
      flame of social revolution? Who could have foreseen? Nobody! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      perfect, diabolic surprise,&rdquo; thought Razumov, calm-faced in his attitude
      of inscrutable superiority, nodding assent to Sophia Antonovna&rsquo;s remarks
      upon the psychology of &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; rather
      coldly, but with a nervous longing in his fingers to tear some sort of
      confession out of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at the very last, on the point of separating, the feeling of relaxed
      tension already upon him, he heard Sophia Antonovna allude to the subject
      of his uneasiness. How it came about he could only guess, his mind being
      absent at the moment, but it must have sprung from Sophia Antonovna&rsquo;s
      complaints of the illogical absurdity of the people. For instance&mdash;that
      Ziemianitch was notoriously irreligious, and yet, in the last weeks of his
      life, he suffered from the notion that he had been beaten by the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; repeated Razumov, as though he had not heard aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The actual devil. The devil in person. You may well look astonished,
      Kirylo Sidorovitch. Early on the very night poor Haldin was taken, a
      complete stranger turned up and gave Ziemianitch a most fearful thrashing
      while he was lying dead-drunk in the stable. The wretched creature&rsquo;s body
      was one mass of bruises. He showed them to the people in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, Sophia Antonovna, you don&rsquo;t believe in the actual devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; retorted the woman curtly. &ldquo;Not but that there are plenty of men
      worse than devils to make a hell of this earth,&rdquo; she muttered to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov watched her, vigorous and white-haired, with the deep fold between
      her thin eyebrows, and her black glance turned idly away. It was obvious
      that she did not make much of the story&mdash;unless, indeed, this was the
      perfection of duplicity. &ldquo;A dark young man,&rdquo; she explained further. &ldquo;Never
      seen there before, never seen afterwards. Why are you smiling, Razumov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the devil being still young after all these ages,&rdquo; he answered
      composedly. &ldquo;But who was able to describe him, since the victim, you say,
      was dead-drunk at the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! The eating-house keeper has described him. An overbearing, swarthy
      young man in a student&rsquo;s cloak, who came rushing in, demanded Ziemianitch,
      beat him furiously, and rushed away without a word, leaving the
      eating-house keeper paralysed with astonishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he, too, believe it was the devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t say. I am told he&rsquo;s very reserved on the matter. Those
      sellers of spirits are great scoundrels generally. I should think he knows
      more of it than anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and you, Sophia Antonovna, what&rsquo;s your theory?&rdquo; asked Razumov in a
      tone of great interest. &ldquo;Yours and your informant&rsquo;s, who is on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with him. Some police-hound in disguise. Who else could beat a
      helpless man so unmercifully? As for the rest, if they were out that day
      on every trail, old and new, it is probable enough that they might have
      thought it just as well to have Ziemianitch at hand for more information,
      or for identification, or what not. Some scoundrelly detective was sent to
      fetch him along, and being vexed at finding him so drunk broke a stable
      fork over his ribs. Later on, after they had the big game safe in the net,
      they troubled their heads no more about that peasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the last words of the woman revolutionist in this conversation,
      keeping so close to the truth, departing from it so far in the
      verisimilitude of thoughts and conclusions as to give one the notion of
      the invincible nature of human error, a glimpse into the utmost depths of
      self-deception. Razumov, after shaking hands with Sophia Antonovna, left
      the grounds, crossed the road, and walking out on the little steamboat
      pier leaned over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was at ease; ease such as he had not known for many days, ever
      since that night...the night. The conversation with the woman
      revolutionist had given him the view of his danger at the very moment this
      danger vanished, characteristically enough. &ldquo;I ought to have foreseen the
      doubts that would arise in those people&rsquo;s minds,&rdquo; he thought. Then his
      attention being attracted by a stone of peculiar shape, which he could see
      clearly lying at the bottom, he began to speculate as to the depth of
      water in that spot. But very soon, with a start of wonder at this
      extraordinary instance of ill-timed detachment, he returned to his train
      of thought. &ldquo;I ought to have told very circumstantial lies from the
      first,&rdquo; he said to himself, with a mortal distaste of the mere idea which
      silenced his mental utterance for quite a perceptible interval. &ldquo;Luckily,
      that&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; he reflected, and after a time spoke to himself,
      half aloud, &ldquo;Thanks to the devil,&rdquo; and laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of Ziemianitch then arrested his wandering thoughts. He was not
      exactly amused at the interpretation, but he could not help detecting in
      it a certain piquancy. He owned to himself that, had he known of that
      suicide before leaving Russia, he would have been incapable of making such
      excellent use of it for his own purposes. He ought to be infinitely
      obliged to the fellow with the red nose for his patience and ingenuity, &ldquo;A
      wonderful psychologist apparently,&rdquo; he said to himself sarcastically.
      Remorse, indeed! It was a striking example of your true conspirator&rsquo;s
      blindness, of the stupid subtlety of people with one idea. This was a
      drama of love, not of conscience, Razumov continued to himself mockingly.
      A woman the old fellow was making up to! A robust pedlar, clearly a rival,
      throwing him down a flight of stairs.... And at sixty, for a lifelong
      lover, it was not an easy matter to get over. That was a feminist of a
      different stamp from Peter Ivanovitch. Even the comfort of the bottle
      might conceivably fail him in this supreme crisis. At such an age nothing
      but a halter could cure the pangs of an unquenchable passion. And,
      besides, there was the wild exasperation aroused by the unjust aspersions
      and the contumely of the house, with the maddening impossibility to
      account for that mysterious thrashing, added to these simple and bitter
      sorrows. &ldquo;Devil, eh?&rdquo; Razumov exclaimed, with mental excitement, as if he
      had made an interesting discovery. &ldquo;Ziemianitch ended by falling into
      mysticism. So many of our true Russian souls end in that way! Very
      characteristic.&rdquo; He felt pity for Ziemianitch, a large neutral pity, such
      as one may feel for an unconscious multitude, a great people seen from
      above&mdash;like a community of crawling ants working out its destiny. It
      was as if this Ziemianitch could not possibly have done anything else. And
      Sophia Antonovna&rsquo;s cocksure and contemptuous &ldquo;some police-hound&rdquo; was
      characteristically Russian in another way. But there was no tragedy there.
      This was a comedy of errors. It was as if the devil himself were playing a
      game with all of them in turn. First with him, then with Ziemianitch, then
      with those revolutionists. The devil&rsquo;s own game this.... He interrupted
      his earnest mental soliloquy with a jocular thought at his own expense.
      &ldquo;Hallo! I am falling into mysticism too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mind was more at ease than ever. Turning about he put his back against
      the rail comfortably. &ldquo;All this fits with marvellous aptness,&rdquo; he
      continued to think. &ldquo;The brilliance of my reputed exploit is no longer
      darkened by the fate of my supposed colleague. The mystic Ziemianitch
      accounts for that. An incredible chance has served me. No more need of
      lies. I shall have only to listen and to keep my scorn from getting the
      upper hand of my caution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, folded his arms, his chin dropped on his breast, and it was a
      long time before he started forward from that pose, with the recollection
      that he had made up his mind to do something important that day. What it
      was he could not immediately recall, yet he made no effort of memory, for
      he was uneasily certain that he would remember presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone more than a hundred yards towards the town when he slowed
      down, almost faltered in his walk, at the sight of a figure walking in the
      contrary direction, draped in a cloak, under a soft, broad-brimmed hat,
      picturesque but diminutive, as if seen through the big end of an
      opera-glass. It was impossible to avoid that tiny man, for there was no
      issue for retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another one going to that mysterious meeting,&rdquo; thought Razumov. He was
      right in his surmise, only <i>this</i> one, unlike the others who came
      from a distance, was known to him personally. Still, he hoped to pass on
      with a mere bow, but it was impossible to ignore the little thin hand with
      hairy wrist and knuckles protruded in a friendly wave from under the folds
      of the cloak, worn Spanish-wise, in disregard of a fairly warm day, a
      corner flung over the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is Herr Razumov?&rdquo; sounded the greeting in German, by that alone
      made more odious to the object of the affable recognition. At closer
      quarters the diminutive personage looked like a reduction of an
      ordinary-sized man, with a lofty brow bared for a moment by the raising of
      the hat, the great pepper-and salt full beard spread over the
      proportionally broad chest. A fine bold nose jutted over a thin mouth
      hidden in the mass of fine hair. All this, accented features, strong limbs
      in their relative smallness, appeared delicate without the slightest sign
      of debility. The eyes alone, almond-shaped and brown, were too big, with
      the whites slightly bloodshot by much pen labour under a lamp. The obscure
      celebrity of the tiny man was well known to Razumov. Polyglot, of unknown
      parentage, of indefinite nationality, anarchist, with a pedantic and
      ferocious temperament, and an amazingly inflammatory capacity for
      invective, he was a power in the background, this violent pamphleteer
      clamouring for revolutionary justice, this Julius Laspara, editor of the
      <i>Living Word</i>, confidant of conspirators, inditer of sanguinary
      menaces and manifestos, suspected of being in the secret of every plot.
      Laspara lived in the old town in a sombre, narrow house presented to him
      by a naive middle-class admirer of his humanitarian eloquence. With him
      lived his two daughters, who overtopped him head and shoulders, and a
      pasty-faced, lean boy of six, languishing in the dark rooms in blue cotton
      overalls and clumsy boots, who might have belonged to either one of them
      or to neither. No stranger could tell. Julius Laspara no doubt knew which
      of his girls it was who, after casually vanishing for a few years, had as
      casually returned to him possessed of that child; but, with admirable
      pedantry, he had refrained from asking her for details&mdash;no, not so
      much as the name of the father, because maternity should be an anarchist
      function. Razumov had been admitted twice to that suite of several small
      dark rooms on the top floor: dusty window-panes, litter of all sorts of
      sweepings all over the place, half-full glasses of tea forgotten on every
      table, the two Laspara daughters prowling about enigmatically silent,
      sleepy-eyed, corsetless, and generally, in their want of shape and the
      disorder of their rumpled attire, resembling old dolls; the great but
      obscure Julius, his feet twisted round his three-legged stool, always
      ready to receive the visitors, the pen instantly dropped, the body screwed
      round with a striking display of the lofty brow and of the great austere
      beard. When he got down from his stool it was as though he had descended
      from the heights of Olympus. He was dwarfed by his daughters, by the
      furniture, by any caller of ordinary stature. But he very seldom left it,
      and still more rarely was seen walking in broad daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been some matter of serious importance which had driven him
      out in that direction that afternoon. Evidently he wished to be amiable to
      that young man whose arrival had made some sensation in the world of
      political refugees. In Russian now, which he spoke, as he spoke and wrote
      four or five other European languages, without distinction and without
      force (other than that of invective), he inquired if Razumov had taken his
      inscriptions at the University as yet. And the young man, shaking his head
      negatively&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time for that. But, meantime, are you not going to
      write something for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not understand how any one could refrain from writing on
      anything, social, economic, historical&mdash;anything. Any subject could
      be treated in the right spirit, and for the ends of social revolution.
      And, as it happened, a friend of his in London had got in touch with a
      review of advanced ideas. &ldquo;We must educate, educate everybody&mdash;develop
      the great thought of absolute liberty and of revolutionary justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov muttered rather surlily that he did not even know English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write in Russian. We&rsquo;ll have it translated There can be no difficulty.
      Why, without seeking further, there is Miss Haldin. My daughters go to see
      her sometimes.&rdquo; He nodded significantly. &ldquo;She does nothing, has never done
      anything in her life. She would be quite competent, with a little
      assistance. Only write. You know you must. And so good-bye for the
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his arm and went on. Razumov backed against the low wall, looked
      after him, spat violently, and went on his way with an angry mutter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cursed Jew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not know anything about it. Julius Laspara might have been a
      Transylvanian, a Turk, an Andalusian, or a citizen of one of the Hanse
      towns for anything he could tell to the contrary. But this is not a story
      of the West, and this exclamation must be recorded, accompanied by the
      comment that it was merely an expression of hate and contempt, best
      adapted to the nature of the feelings Razumov suffered from at the time.
      He was boiling with rage, as though he had been grossly insulted. He
      walked as if blind, following instinctively the shore of the diminutive
      harbour along the quay, through a pretty, dull garden, where dull people
      sat on chairs under the trees, till, his fury abandoning him, he
      discovered himself in the middle of a long, broad bridge. He slowed down
      at once. To his right, beyond the toy-like jetties, he saw the green
      slopes framing the Petit Lac in all the marvellous banality of the
      picturesque made of painted cardboard, with the more distant stretch of
      water inanimate and shining like a piece of tin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his head away from that view for the tourists, and walked on
      slowly, his eyes fixed on the ground. One or two persons had to get out of
      his way, and then turned round to give a surprised stare to his profound
      absorption. The insistence of the celebrated subversive journalist rankled
      in his mind strangely. Write. Must write! He! Write! A sudden light
      flashed upon him. To write was the very thing he had made up his mind to
      do that day. He had made up his mind irrevocably to that step and then had
      forgotten all about it. That incorrigible tendency to escape from the grip
      of the situation was fraught with serious danger. He was ready to despise
      himself for it. What was it? Levity, or deep-seated weakness? Or an
      unconscious dread?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that I am shrinking? It can&rsquo;t be! It&rsquo;s impossible. To shrink now
      would be worse than moral suicide; it would be nothing less than moral
      damnation,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Is it possible that I have a conventional
      conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rejected that hypothesis with scorn, and, checked on the edge of the
      pavement, made ready to cross the road and proceed up the wide street
      facing the head of the bridge; and that for no other reason except that it
      was there before him. But at the moment a couple of carriages and a
      slow-moving cart interposed, and suddenly he turned sharp to the left,
      following the quay again, but now away from the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be just my health,&rdquo; he thought, allowing himself a very unusual
      doubt of his soundness; for, with the exception of a childish ailment or
      two, he had never been ill in his life. But that was a danger, too. Only,
      it seemed as though he were being looked after in a specially remarkable
      way. &ldquo;If I believed in an active Providence,&rdquo; Razumov said to himself,
      amused grimly, &ldquo;I would see here the working of an ironical finger. To
      have a Julius Laspara put in my way as if expressly to remind me of my
      purpose is&mdash;Write, he had said. I must write&mdash;I must, indeed! I
      shall write&mdash;never fear. Certainly. That&rsquo;s why I am here. And for the
      future I shall have something to write about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was exciting himself by this mental soliloquy. But the idea of writing
      evoked the thought of a place to write in, of shelter, of privacy, and
      naturally of his lodgings, mingled with a distaste for the necessary
      exertion of getting there, with a mistrust as of some hostile influence
      awaiting him within those odious four walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose one of these revolutionists,&rdquo; he asked himself, &ldquo;were to take a
      fancy to call on me while I am writing?&rdquo; The mere prospect of such an
      interruption made him shudder. One could lock one&rsquo;s door, or ask the
      tobacconist downstairs (some sort of a refugee himself) to tell inquirers
      that one was not in. Not very good precautions those. The manner of his
      life, he felt, must be kept clear of every cause for suspicion or even
      occasion for wonder, down to such trifling occurrences as a delay in
      opening a locked door. &ldquo;I wish I were in the middle of some field miles
      away from everywhere,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had unconsciously turned to the left once more and now was aware of
      being on a bridge again. This one was much narrower than the other, and
      instead of being straight, made a sort of elbow or angle. At the point of
      that angle a short arm joined it to a hexagonal islet with a soil of
      gravel and its shores faced with dressed stone, a perfection of puerile
      neatness. A couple of tall poplars and a few other trees stood grouped on
      the clean, dark gravel, and under them a few garden benches and a bronze
      effigy of Jean Jacques Rousseau seated on its pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On setting his foot on it Razumov became aware that, except for the woman
      in charge of the refreshment chalet, he would be alone on the island.
      There was something of naive, odious, and inane simplicity about that
      unfrequented tiny crumb of earth named after Jean Jacques Rousseau.
      Something pretentious and shabby, too. He asked for a glass of milk, which
      he drank standing, at one draught (nothing but tea had passed his lips
      since the morning), and was going away with a weary, lagging step when a
      thought stopped him short. He had found precisely what he needed. If
      solitude could ever be secured in the open air in the middle of a town, he
      would have it there on this absurd island, together with the faculty of
      watching the only approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back heavily to a garden seat, dropped into it. This was the place
      for making a beginning of that writing which had to be done. The materials
      he had on him. &ldquo;I shall always come here,&rdquo; he said to himself, and
      afterwards sat for quite a long time motionless, without thought and sight
      and hearing, almost without life. He sat long enough for the declining sun
      to dip behind the roofs of the town at his back, and throw the shadow of
      the houses on the lake front over the islet, before he pulled out of his
      pocket a fountain pen, opened a small notebook on his knee, and began to
      write quickly, raising his eyes now and then at the connecting arm of the
      bridge. These glances were needless; the people crossing over in the
      distance seemed unwilling even to look at the islet where the exiled
      effigy of the author of the <i>Social Contract</i> sat enthroned above the
      bowed head of Razumov in the sombre immobility of bronze. After finishing
      his scribbling, Razumov, with a sort of feverish haste, put away the pen,
      then rammed the notebook into his pocket, first tearing out the written
      pages with an almost convulsive brusqueness. But the folding of the flimsy
      batch on his knee was executed with thoughtful nicety. That done, he
      leaned back in his seat and remained motionless, the papers holding in his
      left hand. The twilight had deepened. He got up and began to pace to and
      fro slowly under the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt that now I am safe,&rdquo; he thought. His fine ear could
      detect the faintly accentuated murmurs of the current breaking against the
      point of the island, and he forgot himself in listening to them with
      interest. But even to his acute sense of hearing the sound was too
      elusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary occupation I am giving myself up to,&rdquo; he murmured. And it
      occurred to him that this was about the only sound he could listen to
      innocently, and for his own pleasure, as it were. Yes, the sound of water,
      the voice of the wind&mdash;completely foreign to human passions. All the
      other sounds of this earth brought contamination to the solitude of a
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s feeling, the soul, of course, being his own, and
      the word being used not in the theological sense, but standing, as far as
      I can understand it, for that part of Mr. Razumov which was not his body,
      and more specially in danger from the fires of this earth. And it must be
      admitted that in Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s case the bitterness of solitude from which
      he suffered was not an altogether morbid phenomenon.

    <h2>
      PART FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      That I should, at the beginning of this retrospect, mention again that Mr.
      Razumov&rsquo;s youth had no one in the world, as literally no one as it can be
      honestly affirmed of any human being, is but a statement of fact from a
      man who believes in the psychological value of facts. There is also,
      perhaps, a desire of punctilious fairness. Unidentified with anyone in
      this narrative where the aspects of honour and shame are remote from the
      ideas of the Western world, and taking my stand on the ground of common
      humanity, it is for that very reason that I feel a strange reluctance to
      state baldly here what every reader has most likely already discovered
      himself. Such reluctance may appear absurd if it were not for the thought
      that because of the imperfection of language there is always something
      ungracious (and even disgraceful) in the exhibition of naked truth. But
      the time has come when Councillor of State Mikulin can no longer be
      ignored. His simple question &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; on which we left Mr. Razumov in
      St. Petersburg, throws a light on the general meaning of this individual
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; was the answer in the form of a gentle question to what we may
      call Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s declaration of independence. The question was not
      menacing in the least and, indeed, had the ring of innocent inquiry. Had
      it been taken in a merely topographical sense, the only answer to it would
      have appeared sufficiently appalling to Mr Razumov. Where to? Back to his
      rooms, where the Revolution had sought him out to put to a sudden test his
      dormant instincts, his half-conscious thoughts and almost wholly
      unconscious ambitions, by the touch as of some furious and dogmatic
      religion, with its call to frantic sacrifices, its tender resignations,
      its dreams and hopes uplifting the soul by the side of the most sombre
      moods of despair. And Mr. Razumov had let go the door-handle and had come
      back to the middle of the room, asking Councillor Mikulin angrily, &ldquo;What
      do you mean by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As far as I can tell, Councillor Mikulin did not answer that question. He
      drew Mr. Razumov into familiar conversation. It is the peculiarity of
      Russian natures that, however strongly engaged in the drama of action,
      they are still turning their ear to the murmur of abstract ideas. This
      conversation (and others later on) need not be recorded. Suffice it to say
      that it brought Mr. Razumov as we know him to the test of another faith.
      There was nothing official in its expression, and Mr. Razumov was led to
      defend his attitude of detachment. But Councillor Mikulin would have none
      of his arguments. &ldquo;For a man like you,&rdquo; were his last weighty words in the
      discussion, &ldquo;such a position is impossible. Don&rsquo;t forget that I have seen
      that interesting piece of paper. I understand your liberalism. I have an
      intellect of that kind myself. Reform for me is mainly a question of
      method. But the principle of revolt is a physical intoxication, a sort of
      hysteria which must be kept away from the masses. You agree to this
      without reserve, don&rsquo;t you? Because, you see, Kirylo Sidorovitch,
      abstention, reserve, in certain situations, come very near to political
      crime. The ancient Greeks understood that very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Razumov, listening with a faint smile, asked Councillor Mikulin
      point-blank if this meant that he was going to have him watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high official took no offence at the cynical inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Kirylo Sidorovitch,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to have you
      watched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, suspecting a lie, affected yet the greatest liberty of mind
      during the short remainder of that interview. The older man expressed
      himself throughout in familiar terms, and with a sort of shrewd
      simplicity. Razumov concluded that to get to the bottom of that mind was
      an impossible feat. A great disquiet made his heart beat quicker. The high
      official, issuing from behind the desk, was actually offering to shake
      hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr Razumov. An understanding between intelligent men is always
      a satisfactory occurrence. Is it not? And, of course, these rebel
      gentlemen have not the monopoly of intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume that I shall not be wanted any more?&rdquo; Razumov brought out that
      question while his hand was still being grasped. Councillor Mikulin
      released it slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Mr. Razumov,&rdquo; he said with great earnestness, &ldquo;is as it may be. God
      alone knows the future. But you may rest assured that I never thought of
      having you watched. You are a young man of great independence. Yes. You
      are going away free as air, but you shall end by coming back to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! I!&rdquo; Razumov exclaimed in an appalled murmur of protest. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he
      added feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! You yourself, Kirylo Sidorovitch,&rdquo; the high police functionary
      insisted in a low, severe tone of conviction. &ldquo;You shall be coming back to
      us. Some of our greatest minds had to do that in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no better friend than Prince K&mdash;-, and as to myself it is a
      long time now since I&rsquo;ve been honoured by his....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced down his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t detain you any longer. We live in difficult times, in times of
      monstrous chimeras and evil dreams and criminal follies. We shall
      certainly meet once more. It may be some little time, though, before we
      do. Till then may Heaven send you fruitful reflections!&rdquo; Once in the
      street, Razumov started off rapidly, without caring for the direction. At
      first he thought of nothing; but in a little while the consciousness of
      his position presented itself to him as something so ugly, dangerous, and
      absurd, the difficulty of ever freeing himself from the toils of that
      complication so insoluble, that the idea of going back and, as he termed
      it to himself, confessing to Councillor Mikulin flashed through his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go back! What for? Confess! To what? &ldquo;I have been speaking to him with the
      greatest openness,&rdquo; he said to himself with perfect truth. &ldquo;What else
      could I tell him? That I have undertaken to carry a message to that brute
      Ziemianitch? Establish a false complicity and destroy what chance of
      safety I have won for nothing&mdash;what folly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet he could not defend himself from fancying that Councillor Mikulin was,
      perhaps, the only man in the world able to understand his conduct. To be
      understood appeared extremely fascinating.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way home he had to stop several times; all his strength seemed to
      run out of his limbs; and in the movement of the busy streets, isolated as
      if in a desert, he remained suddenly motionless for a minute or so before
      he could proceed on his way. He reached his rooms at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came an illness, something in the nature of a low fever, which all at
      once removed him to a great distance from the perplexing actualities, from
      his very room, even. He never lost consciousness; he only seemed to
      himself to be existing languidly somewhere very far away from everything
      that had ever happened to him. He came out of this state slowly, with an
      effect, that is to say, of extreme slowness, though the actual number of
      days was not very great. And when he had got back into the middle of
      things they were all changed, subtly and provokingly in their nature:
      inanimate objects, human faces, the landlady, the rustic servant-girl, the
      staircase, the streets, the very air. He tackled these changed conditions
      in a spirit of severity. He walked to and fro to the University, ascended
      stairs, paced the passages, listened to lectures, took notes, crossed
      courtyards in angry aloofness, his teeth set hard till his jaws ached.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly aware of madcap Kostia gazing like a young retriever from
      a distance, of the famished student with the red drooping nose, keeping
      scrupulously away as desired; of twenty others, perhaps, he knew well
      enough to speak to. And they all had an air of curiosity and concern as if
      they expected something to happen. &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t last much longer,&rdquo; thought
      Razumov more than once. On certain days he was afraid that anyone
      addressing him suddenly in a certain way would make him scream out
      insanely a lot of filthy abuse. Often, after returning home, he would drop
      into a chair in his cap and cloak and remain still for hours holding some
      book he had got from the library in his hand; or he would pick up the
      little penknife and sit there scraping his nails endlessly and feeling
      furious all the time&mdash;simply furious. &ldquo;This is impossible,&rdquo; he would
      mutter suddenly to the empty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fact to be noted: this room might conceivably have become physically
      repugnant to him, emotionally intolerable, morally uninhabitable. But no.
      Nothing of the sort (and he had himself dreaded it at first), nothing of
      the sort happened. On the contrary, he liked his lodgings better than any
      other shelter he, who had never known a home, had ever hired before. He
      liked his lodgings so well that often, on that very account, he found a
      certain difficulty in making up his mind to go out. It resembled a
      physical seduction such as, for instance, makes a man reluctant to leave
      the neighbourhood of a fire on a cold day.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as, at that time, he seldom stirred except to go to the University
      (what else was there to do?) it followed that whenever he went abroad he
      felt himself at once closely involved in the moral consequences of his
      act. It was there that the dark prestige of the Haldin mystery fell on
      him, clung to him like a poisoned robe it was impossible to fling off. He
      suffered from it exceedingly, as well as from the conversational,
      commonplace, unavoidable intercourse with the other kind of students.
      &ldquo;They must be wondering at the change in me,&rdquo; he reflected anxiously. He
      had an uneasy recollection of having savagely told one or two innocent,
      nice enough fellows to go to the devil. Once a married professor he used
      to call upon formerly addressed him in passing: &ldquo;How is it we never see
      you at our Wednesdays now, Kirylo Sidorovitch?&rdquo; Razumov was conscious of
      meeting this advance with odious, muttering boorishness. The professor was
      obviously too astonished to be offended. All this was bad. And all this
      was Haldin, always Haldin&mdash;nothing but Haldin&mdash;everywhere
      Haldin: a moral spectre infinitely more effective than any visible
      apparition of the dead. It was only the room through which that man had
      blundered on his way from crime to death that his spectre did not seem to
      be able to haunt. Not, to be exact, that he was ever completely absent
      from it, but that there he had no sort of power. There it was Razumov who
      had the upper hand, in a composed sense of his own superiority. A
      vanquished phantom&mdash;nothing more. Often in the evening, his repaired
      watch faintly ticking on the table by the side of the lighted lamp,
      Razumov would look up from his writing and stare at the bed with an
      expectant, dispassionate attention. Nothing was to be seen there. He never
      really supposed that anything ever could be seen there. After a while he
      would shrug his shoulders slightly and bend again over his work. For he
      had gone to work and, at first, with some success. His unwillingness to
      leave that place where he was safe from Haldin grew so strong that at last
      he ceased to go out at all. From early morning till far into the night he
      wrote, he wrote for nearly a week; never looking at the time, and only
      throwing himself on the bed when he could keep his eyes open no longer.
      Then, one afternoon, quite casually, he happened to glance at his watch.
      He laid down his pen slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this very hour,&rdquo; was his thought, &ldquo;the fellow stole unseen into this
      room while I was out. And there he sat quiet as a mouse&mdash;perhaps in
      this very chair.&rdquo; Razumov got up and began to pace the floor steadily,
      glancing at the watch now and then. &ldquo;This is the time when I returned and
      found him standing against the stove,&rdquo; he observed to himself. When it
      grew dark he lit his lamp. Later on he interrupted his tramping once more,
      only to wave away angrily the girl who attempted to enter the room with
      tea and something to eat on a tray. And presently he noted the watch
      pointing at the hour of his own going forth into the falling snow on that
      terrible errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Complicity,&rdquo; he muttered faintly, and resumed his pacing, keeping his eye
      on the hands as they crept on slowly to the time of his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, after all,&rdquo; he thought suddenly, &ldquo;I might have been the chosen
      instrument of Providence. This is a manner of speaking, but there may be
      truth in every manner of speaking. What if that absurd saying were true in
      its essence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meditated for a while, then sat down, his legs stretched out, with
      stony eyes, and with his arms hanging down on each side of the chair like
      a man totally abandoned by Providence&mdash;desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted the time of Haldin&rsquo;s departure and continued to sit still for
      another half-hour; then muttering, &ldquo;And now to work,&rdquo; drew up to the
      table, seized the pen and instantly dropped it under the influence of a
      profoundly disquieting reflection: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s three weeks gone by and no
      word from Mikulin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What did it mean! Was he forgotten? Possibly. Then why not remain
      forgotten&mdash;creep in somewhere? Hide. But where? How? With whom? In
      what hole? And was it to be for ever, or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      But a retreat was big with shadowy dangers. The eye of the social
      revolution was on him, and Razumov for a moment felt an unnamed and
      despairing dread, mingled with an odious sense of humiliation. Was it
      possible that he no longer belonged to himself? This was damnable. But why
      not simply keep on as before? Study. Advance. Work hard as if nothing had
      happened (and first of all win the Silver Medal), acquire distinction,
      become a great reforming servant of the greatest of States. Servant, too,
      of the mightiest homogeneous mass of mankind with a capability for
      logical, guided development in a brotherly solidarity of force and aim
      such as the world had never dreamt of... the Russian nation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Calm, resolved, steady in his great purpose, he was stretching his hand
      towards the pen when he happened to glance towards the bed. He rushed at
      it, enraged, with a mental scream: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you, crazy fanatic, who stands in
      the way!&rdquo; He flung the pillow on the floor violently, tore the blankets
      aside.... Nothing there. And, turning away, he caught for an instant in
      the air, like a vivid detail in a dissolving view of two heads, the eyes
      of General T&mdash;- and of Privy-Councillor Mikulin side by side fixed
      upon him, quite different in character, but with the same unflinching and
      weary and yet purposeful expression...servants of the nation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov tottered to the washstand very alarmed about himself, drank some
      water and bathed his forehead. &ldquo;This will pass and leave no trace,&rdquo; he
      thought confidently. &ldquo;I am all right.&rdquo; But as to supposing that he had
      been forgotten it was perfect nonsense. He was a marked man on that side.
      And that was nothing. It was what that miserable phantom stood for which
      had to be got out of the way.... &ldquo;If one only could go and spit it all out
      at some of them&mdash;and take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He imagined himself accosting the red-nosed student and suddenly shaking
      his fist in his face. &ldquo;From that one, though,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      nothing to be got, because he has no mind of his own. He&rsquo;s living in a red
      democratic trance. Ah! you want to smash your way into universal
      happiness, my boy. I will give you universal happiness, you silly,
      hypnotized ghoul, you! And what about my own happiness, eh? Haven&rsquo;t I got
      any right to it, just because I can think for myself?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again, but with a different mental accent, Razumov said to himself, &ldquo;I
      am young. Everything can be lived down.&rdquo; At that moment he was crossing
      the room slowly, intending to sit down on the sofa and try to compose his
      thoughts. But before he had got so far everything abandoned him&mdash;hope,
      courage, belief in himself trust in men. His heart had, as it were,
      suddenly emptied itself. It was no use struggling on. Rest, work,
      solitude, and the frankness of intercourse with his kind were alike
      forbidden to him. Everything was gone. His existence was a great cold
      blank, something like the enormous plain of the whole of Russia levelled
      with snow and fading gradually on all sides into shadows and mists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, with swimming head, closed his eyes, and remained like that,
      sitting bolt upright on the sofa and perfectly awake for the rest of the
      night; till the girl bustling into the outer room with the samovar thumped
      with her fist on the door, calling out, &ldquo;Kirylo Sidorovitch, please! It is
      time for you to get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, pale like a corpse obeying the dread summons of judgement, Razumov
      opened his eyes and got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody will be surprised to hear, I suppose, that when the summons came he
      went to see Councillor Mikulin. It came that very morning, while, looking
      white and shaky, like an invalid just out of bed, he was trying to shave
      himself. The envelope was addressed in the little attorney&rsquo;s handwriting.
      That envelope contained another, superscribed to Razumov, in Prince K&mdash;-&rsquo;s
      hand, with the request &ldquo;Please forward under cover at once&rdquo; in a corner.
      The note inside was an autograph of Councillor Mikulin. The writer stated
      candidly that nothing had arisen which needed clearing up, but
      nevertheless appointed a meeting with Mr. Razumov at a certain address in
      town which seemed to be that of an oculist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov read it, finished shaving, dressed, looked at the note again, and
      muttered gloomily, &ldquo;Oculist.&rdquo; He pondered over it for a time, lit a match,
      and burned the two envelopes and the enclosure carefully. Afterwards he
      waited, sitting perfectly idle and not even looking at anything in
      particular till the appointed hour drew near&mdash;and then went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether, looking at the unofficial character of the summons, he might have
      refrained from attending to it is hard to say. Probably not. At any rate,
      he went; but, what&rsquo;s more, he went with a certain eagerness, which may
      appear incredible till it is remembered that Councillor Mikulin was the
      only person on earth with whom Razumov could talk, taking the Haldin
      adventure for granted. And Haldin, when once taken for granted, was no
      longer a haunting, falsehood-breeding spectre. Whatever troubling power he
      exercised in all the other places of the earth, Razumov knew very well
      that at this oculist&rsquo;s address he would be merely the hanged murderer of
      M. de P&mdash;- and nothing more. For the dead can live only with the
      exact intensity and quality of the life imparted to them by the living. So
      Mr. Razumov, certain of relief, went to meet Councillor Mikulin with he
      eagerness of a pursued person welcoming any sort of shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much said, there is no need to tell anything more of that first
      interview and of the several others. To the morality of a Western reader
      an account of these meetings would wear perhaps the sinister character of
      old legendary tales where the Enemy of Mankind is represented holding
      subtly mendacious dialogues with some tempted soul. It is not my part to
      protest. Let me but remark that the Evil One, with his single passion of
      satanic pride for the only motive, is yet, on a larger, modern view,
      allowed to be not quite so black as he used to be painted. With what
      greater latitude, then, should we appraise the exact shade of mere mortal
      man, with his many passions and his miserable ingenuity in error, always
      dazzled by the base glitter of mixed motives, everlastingly betrayed by a
      short-sighted wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin was one of those powerful officials who, in a position
      not obscure, not occult, but simply inconspicuous, exercise a great
      influence over the methods rather than over the conduct of affairs. A
      devotion to Church and Throne is not in itself a criminal sentiment; to
      prefer the will of one to the will of many does not argue the possession
      of a black heart or prove congenital idiocy. Councillor Mikulin was not
      only a clever but also a faithful official. Privately he was a bachelor
      with a love of comfort, living alone in an apartment of five rooms
      luxuriously furnished; and was known by his intimates to be an enlightened
      patron of the art of female dancing. Later on the larger world first heard
      of him in the very hour of his downfall, during one of those State trials
      which astonish and puzzle the average plain man who reads the newspapers,
      by a glimpse of unsuspected intrigues. And in the stir of vaguely seen
      monstrosities, in that momentary, mysterious disturbance of muddy waters,
      Councillor Mikulin went under, dignified, with only a calm, emphatic
      protest of his innocence&mdash;nothing more. No disclosures damaging to a
      harassed autocracy, complete fidelity to the secrets of the miserable <i>arcana
      imperii</i> deposited in his patriotic breast, a display of bureaucratic
      stoicism in a Russian official&rsquo;s ineradicable, almost sublime contempt for
      truth; stoicism of silence understood only by the very few of the
      initiated, and not without a certain cynical grandeur of self-sacrifice on
      the part of a sybarite. For the terribly heavy sentence turned Councillor
      Mikulin civilly into a corpse, and actually into something very much like
      a common convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that the savage autocracy, no more than the divine democracy,
      does not limit its diet exclusively to the bodies of its enemies. It
      devours its friends and servants as well. The downfall of His Excellency
      Gregory Gregorievitch Mikulin (which did not occur till some years later)
      completes all that is known of the man. But at the time of M. de P&mdash;-&rsquo;s
      murder (or execution) Councillor Mikulin, under the modest style of Head
      of Department at the General Secretariat, exercised a wide influence as
      the confidant and right-hand man of his former schoolfellow and lifelong
      friend, General T&mdash;-. One can imagine them talking over the case of
      Mr. Razumov, with the full sense of their unbounded power over all the
      lives in Russia, with cursory disdain, like two Olympians glancing at a
      worm. The relationship with Prince K&mdash;- was enough to save Razumov
      from some carelessly arbitrary proceeding, and it is also very probable
      that after the interview at the Secretariat he would have been left alone.
      Councillor Mikulin would not have forgotten him (he forgot no one who ever
      fell under his observation), but would have simply dropped him for ever.
      Councillor Mikulin was a good-natured man and wished no harm to anyone.
      Besides (with his own reforming tendencies) he was favourably impressed by
      that young student, the son of Prince K&mdash;-, and apparently no fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as fate would have it, while Mr. Razumov was finding that no way of
      life was possible to him, Councillor Mikulin&rsquo;s discreet abilities were
      rewarded by a very responsible post&mdash;nothing less than the direction
      of the general police supervision over Europe. And it was then, and then
      only, when taking in hand the perfecting of the service which watches the
      revolutionist activities abroad, that he thought again of Mr. Razumov. He
      saw great possibilities of special usefulness in that uncommon young man
      on whom he had a hold already, with his peculiar temperament, his
      unsettled mind and shaken conscience, a struggling in the toils of a false
      position.... It was as if the revolutionists themselves had put into his
      hand that tool so much finer than the common base instruments, so
      perfectly fitted, if only vested with sufficient credit, to penetrate into
      places inaccessible to common informers. Providential! Providential! And
      Prince K&mdash;-, taken into the secret, was ready enough to adopt that
      mystical view too. &ldquo;It will be necessary, though, to make a career for him
      afterwards,&rdquo; he had stipulated anxiously. &ldquo;Oh! absolutely. We shall make
      that our affair,&rdquo; Mikulin had agreed. Prince K&mdash;-&rsquo;s mysticism was of
      an artless kind; but Councillor Mikulin was astute enough for two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things and men have always a certain sense, a certain side by which they
      must be got hold of if one wants to obtain a solid grasp and a perfect
      command. The power of Councillor Mikulin consisted in the ability to seize
      upon that sense, that side in the men he used. It did not matter to him
      what it was&mdash;vanity, despair, love, hate, greed, intelligent pride or
      stupid conceit, it was all one to him as long as the man could be made to
      serve. The obscure, unrelated young student Razumov, in the moment of
      great moral loneliness, was allowed to feel that he was an object of
      interest to a small group of people of high position. Prince K&mdash;- was
      persuaded to intervene personally, and on a certain occasion gave way to a
      manly emotion which, all unexpected as it was, quite upset Mr. Razumov.
      The sudden embrace of that man, agitated by his loyalty to a throne and by
      suppressed paternal affection, was a revelation to Mr. Razumov of
      something within his own breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was it!&rdquo; he exclaimed to himself. A sort of contemptuous
      tenderness softened the young man&rsquo;s grim view of his position as he
      reflected upon that agitated interview with Prince K&mdash;-. This
      simpleminded, worldly ex-Guardsman and senator whose soft grey official
      whiskers had brushed against his cheek, his aristocratic and convinced
      father, was he a whit less estimable or more absurd than that
      famine-stricken, fanatical revolutionist, the red-nosed student?
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was some pressure, too, besides the persuasiveness. Mr. Razumov
      was always being made to feel that he had committed himself. There was no
      getting away from that feeling, from that soft, unanswerable, &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
       of Councillor Mikulin. But no susceptibilities were ever hurt. It was to
      be a dangerous mission to Geneva for obtaining, at a critical moment,
      absolutely reliable information from a very inaccessible quarter of the
      inner revolutionary circle. There were indications that a very serious
      plot was being matured.... The repose indispensable to a great country was
      at stake.... A great scheme of orderly reforms would be endangered.... The
      highest personages in the land were patriotically uneasy, and so on. In
      short, Councillor Mikulin knew what to say. This skill is to be inferred
      clearly from the mental and psychological self-confession, self-analysis
      of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s written journal&mdash;the pitiful resource of a young man
      who had near him no trusted intimacy, no natural affection to turn to.
    </p>
    <p>
      How all this preliminary work was concealed from observation need not be
      recorded. The expedient of the oculist gives a sufficient instance.
      Councillor Mikulin was resourceful, and the task not very difficult. Any
      fellow-student, even the red-nosed one, was perfectly welcome to see Mr.
      Razumov entering a private house to consult an oculist. Ultimate success
      depended solely on the revolutionary self-delusion which credited Razumov
      with a mysterious complicity in the Haldin affair. To be compromised in it
      was credit enough-and it was their own doing. It was precisely <i>that</i>
      which stamped Mr. Razumov as a providential man, wide as poles apart from
      the usual type of agent for &ldquo;European supervision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was <i>that</i> which the Secretariat set itself the task to foster
      by a course of calculated and false indiscretions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came at last to this, that one evening Mr. Razumov was unexpectedly
      called upon by one of the &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; students whom formerly, before the
      Haldin affair, he used to meet at various private gatherings; a big fellow
      with a quiet, unassuming manner and a pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing his voice raised in the ante-room, &ldquo;May one come in?&rdquo; Razumov,
      lounging idly on his couch, jumped up. &ldquo;Suppose he were coming to stab
      me?&rdquo; he thought sardonically, and, assuming a green shade over his left
      eye, said in a severe tone, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other was embarrassed; hoped he was not intruding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been seen for several days, and I&rsquo;ve wondered.&rdquo; He coughed a
      little. &ldquo;Eye better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly well now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. I won&rsquo;t stop a minute; but you see I, that is, we&mdash;anyway, I
      have undertaken the duty to warn you, Kirylo Sidorovitch, that you are
      living in false security maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov sat still with his head leaning on his hand, which nearly
      concealed the unshaded eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have that idea, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then. Everything seems quiet now, but those people are
      preparing some move of general repression. That&rsquo;s of course. But it isn&rsquo;t
      that I came to tell you.&rdquo; He hitched his chair closer, dropped his voice.
      &ldquo;You will be arrested before long&mdash;we fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An obscure scribe in the Secretariat had overheard a few words of a
      certain conversation, and had caught a glimpse of a certain report. This
      intelligence was not to be neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov laughed a little, and his visitor became very anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Kirylo Sidorovitch, this is no laughing matter. They have left you
      alone for a while, but...! Indeed, you had better try to leave the
      country, Kirylo Sidorovitch, while there&rsquo;s yet time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov jumped up and began to thank him for the advice with mocking
      effusiveness, so that the other, colouring up, took himself off with the
      notion that this mysterious Razumov was not a person to be warned or
      advised by inferior mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin, informed the next day of the incident, expressed his
      satisfaction. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Ha! Exactly what was wanted to...&rdquo; and glanced down
      his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conclude,&rdquo; said Razumov, &ldquo;that the moment has come for me to start on
      my mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The psychological Moment,&rdquo; Councillor Mikulin insisted softly&mdash;very
      gravely&mdash;as if awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the arrangements to give verisimilitude to the appearance of a
      difficult escape were made. Councillor Mikulin did not expect to see Mr.
      Razumov again before his departure. These meetings were a risk, and there
      was nothing more to settle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have said everything to each other by now, Kirylo Sidorovitch,&rdquo; said
      the high official feelingly, pressing Razumov&rsquo;s hand with that unreserved
      heartiness a Russian can convey in his manner. &ldquo;There is nothing obscure
      between us. And I will tell you what! I consider myself fortunate in
      having&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;your...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced down his beard, and, after a moment of thoughtful silence,
      handed to Razumov a half-sheet of notepaper&mdash;an abbreviated note of
      matters already discussed, certain points of inquiry, the line of conduct
      agreed on, a few hints as to personalities, and so on. It was the only
      compromising document in the case, but, as Councillor Mikulin observed,
      &ldquo;it could be easily destroyed. Mr. Razumov had better not see any one now&mdash;till
      on the other side of the frontier, when, of course, it will be just
      that.... See and hear and...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced down his beard; but when Razumov declared his intention to see
      one person at least before leaving St. Petersburg, Councillor Mikulin
      failed to conceal a sudden uneasiness. The young man&rsquo;s studious, solitary,
      and austere existence was well known to him. It was the greatest guarantee
      of fitness. He became deprecatory. Had his dear Kirylo Sidorovitch
      considered whether, in view of such a momentous enterprise, it wasn&rsquo;t
      really advisable to sacrifice every sentiment....
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov interrupted the remonstrance scornfully. It was not a young woman,
      it was a young fool he wished to see for a certain purpose. Councillor
      Mikulin was relieved, but surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And what for&mdash;precisely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of improving the aspect of verisimilitude,&rdquo; said Razumov
      curtly, in a desire to affirm his independence. &ldquo;I must be trusted in what
      I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Councillor Mikulin gave way tactfully, murmuring, &ldquo;Oh, certainly,
      certainly. Your judgment...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with another handshake they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fool of whom Mr. Razumov had thought was the rich and festive student
      known as madcap Kostia. Feather-headed, loquacious, excitable, one could
      make certain of his utter and complete indiscretion. But that riotous
      youth, when reminded by Razumov of his offers of service some time ago,
      passed from his usual elation into boundless dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kirylo Sidorovitch, my dearest friend&mdash;my saviour&mdash;what
      shall I do? I&rsquo;ve blown last night every rouble I had from my dad the other
      day. Can&rsquo;t you give me till Thursday? I shall rush round to all the
      usurers I know.... No, of course, you can&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t look at me like that.
      What shall I do? No use asking the old man. I tell you he&rsquo;s given me a
      fistful of big notes three days ago. Miserable wretch that I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrung his hands in despair. Impossible to confide in the old man.
      &ldquo;They&rdquo; had given him a decoration, a cross on the neck only last year, and
      he had been cursing the modern tendencies ever since. Just then he would
      see all the intellectuals in Russia hanged in a row rather than part with
      a single rouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirylo Sidorovitch, wait a moment. Don&rsquo;t despise me. I have it. I&rsquo;ll, yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      do it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll break into his desk. There&rsquo;s no help for it. I know the
      drawer where he keeps his plunder, and I can buy a chisel on my way home.
      He will be terribly upset, but, you know, the dear old duffer really loves
      me. He&rsquo;ll have to get over it&mdash;and I, too. Kirylo, my dear soul, if
      you can only wait for a few hours-till this evening&mdash;I shall steal
      all the blessed lot I can lay my hands on! You doubt me! Why? You&rsquo;ve only
      to say the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steal, by all means,&rdquo; said Razumov, fixing him stonily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil with the ten commandments!&rdquo; cried the other, with the
      greatest animation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the new future now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when he entered Razumov&rsquo;s room late in the evening it was with an
      unaccustomed soberness of manner, almost solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov sitting bowed, his clasped hands hanging between his knees,
      shuddered at the familiar sound of these words. Kostia deposited slowly in
      the circle of lamplight a small brown-paper parcel tied with a piece of
      string.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said&mdash;all I could lay my hands on. The old boy&rsquo;ll think the
      end of the world has come.&rdquo; Razumov nodded from the couch, and
      contemplated the hare-brained fellow&rsquo;s gravity with a feeling of malicious
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made my little sacrifice,&rdquo; sighed mad Kostia. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve to thank
      you, Kirylo Sidorovitch, for the opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has cost you something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it has. You see, the dear old duffer really loves me. He&rsquo;ll be
      hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you believe all they tell you of the new future and the sacred will
      of the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Implicitly. I would give my life.... Only, you see, I am like a pig at a
      trough. I am no good. It&rsquo;s my nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov, lost in thought, had forgotten his existence till the youth&rsquo;s
      voice, entreating him to fly without loss of time, roused him
      unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Well&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to leave you till I&rsquo;ve seen you out of St. Petersburg,&rdquo;
       declared Kostia unexpectedly, with calm determination. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t refuse
      me that now. For God&rsquo;s sake, Kirylo, my soul, the police may be here any
      moment, and when they get you they&rsquo;ll immure you somewhere for ages&mdash;till
      your hair turns grey. I have down there the best trotter of dad&rsquo;s stables
      and a light sledge. We shall do thirty miles before the moon sets, and
      find some roadside station....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov looked up amazed. The journey was decided&mdash;unavoidable. He
      had fixed the next day for his departure on the mission. And now he
      discovered suddenly that he had not believed in it. He had gone about
      listening, speaking, thinking, planning his simulated flight, with the
      growing conviction that all this was preposterous. As if anybody ever did
      such things! It was like a game of make-believe. And now he was amazed!
      Here was somebody who believed in it with desperate earnestness. &ldquo;If I
      don&rsquo;t go now, at once,&rdquo; thought Razumov, with a start of fear, &ldquo;I shall
      never go.&rdquo; He rose without a word, and the anxious Kostia thrust his cap
      on him, helped him into his cloak, or else he would have left the room
      bareheaded as he stood. He was walking out silently when a sharp cry
      arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kirylo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; He turned reluctantly in the doorway. Upright, with a stiffly
      extended arm, Kostia, his face set and white, was pointing an eloquent
      forefinger at the brown little packet lying forgotten in the circle of
      bright light on the table. Razumov hesitated, came back for it under the
      severe eyes of his companion, at whom he tried to smile. But the boyish,
      mad youth was frowning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dream,&rdquo; thought Razumov, putting the
      little parcel into his pocket and descending the stairs; &ldquo;nobody does such
      things.&rdquo; The other held him under the arm, whispering of dangers ahead,
      and of what he meant to do in certain contingencies. &ldquo;Preposterous,&rdquo;
       murmured Razumov, as he was being tucked up in the sledge. He gave himself
      up to watching the development of the dream with extreme attention. It
      continued on foreseen lines, inexorably logical&mdash;the long drive, the
      wait at the small station sitting by a stove. They did not exchange half a
      dozen words altogether. Kostia, gloomy himself, did not care to break the
      silence. At parting they embraced twice&mdash;it had to be done; and then
      Kostia vanished out of the dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dawn broke, Razumov, very still in a hot, stuffy railway-car full of
      bedding and of sleeping people in all its dimly lighted length, rose
      quietly, lowered the glass a few inches, and flung out on the great plain
      of snow a small brown-paper parcel. Then he sat down again muffled up and
      motionless. &ldquo;For the people,&rdquo; he thought, staring out of the window. The
      great white desert of frozen, hard earth glided past his eyes without a
      sign of human habitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had been a waking act; and then the dream had him again: Prussia,
      Saxony, Wurtemberg, faces, sights, words&mdash;all a dream, observed with
      an angry, compelled attention. Zurich, Geneva&mdash;still a dream,
      minutely followed, wearing one into harsh laughter, to fury, to death&mdash;with
      the fear of awakening at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps life is just that,&rdquo; reflected Razumov, pacing to and fro under
      the trees of the little island, all alone with the bronze statue of
      Rousseau. &ldquo;A dream and a fear.&rdquo; The dusk deepened. The pages written over
      and torn out of his notebook were the first-fruit of his &ldquo;mission.&rdquo; No
      dream that. They contained the assurance that he was on the eve of real
      discoveries. &ldquo;I think there is no longer anything in the way of my being
      completely accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had resumed his impressions in those pages, some of the conversations.
      He even went so far as to write: &ldquo;By the by, I have discovered the
      personality of that terrible N.N. A horrible, paunchy brute. If I hear
      anything of his future movements I shall send a warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The futility of all this overcame him like a curse. Even then he could not
      believe in the reality of his mission. He looked round despairingly, as if
      for some way to redeem his existence from that unconquerable feeling. He
      crushed angrily in his hand the pages of the notebook. &ldquo;This must be
      posted,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gained the bridge and returned to the north shore, where he remembered
      having seen in one of the narrower streets a little obscure shop stocked
      with cheap wood carvings, its walls lined with extremely dirty
      cardboard-bound volumes of a small circulating library. They sold
      stationery there, too. A morose, shabby old man dozed behind the counter.
      A thin woman in black, with a sickly face, produced the envelope he had
      asked for without even looking at him. Razumov thought that these people
      were safe to deal with because they no longer cared for anything in the
      world. He addressed the envelope on the counter with the German name of a
      certain person living in Vienna. But Razumov knew that this, his first
      communication for Councillor Mikulin, would find its way to the Embassy
      there, be copied in cypher by somebody trustworthy, and sent on to its
      destination, all safe, along with the diplomatic correspondence. That was
      the arrangement contrived to cover up the track of the information from
      all unfaithful eyes, from all indiscretions, from all mishaps and
      treacheries. It was to make him safe&mdash;absolutely safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered out of the wretched shop and made for the post office. It was
      then that I saw him for the second time that day. He was crossing the Rue
      Mont Blanc with every appearance of an aimless stroller. He did not
      recognize me, but I made him out at some distance. He was very
      good-looking, I thought, this remarkable friend of Miss Haldin&rsquo;s brother.
      I watched him go up to the letter-box and then retrace his steps. Again he
      passed me very close, but I am certain he did not see me that time,
      either. He carried his head well up, but he had the expression of a
      somnambulist struggling with the very dream which drives him forth to
      wander in dangerous places. My thoughts reverted to Natalia Haldin, to her
      mother. He was all that was left to them of their son and brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The westerner in me was discomposed. There was something shocking in the
      expression of that face. Had I been myself a conspirator, a Russian
      political refugee, I could have perhaps been able to draw some practical
      conclusion from this chance glimpse. As it was, it only discomposed me
      strongly, even to the extent of awakening an indefinite apprehension in
      regard to Natalia Haldin. All this is rather inexplicable, but such was
      the origin of the purpose I formed there and then to call on these ladies
      in the evening, after my solitary dinner. It was true that I had met Miss
      Haldin only a few hours before, but Mrs. Haldin herself I had not seen for
      some considerable time. The truth is, I had shirked calling of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Haldin! I confess she frightened me a little. She was one of
      those natures, rare enough, luckily, in which one cannot help being
      interested, because they provoke both terror and pity. One dreads their
      contact for oneself, and still more for those one cares for, so clear it
      is that they are born to suffer and to make others suffer, too. It is
      strange to think that, I won&rsquo;t say liberty, but the mere liberalism of
      outlook which for us is a matter of words, of ambitions, of votes (and if
      of feeling at all, then of the sort of feeling which leaves our deepest
      affections untouched), may be for other beings very much like ourselves
      and living under the same sky, a heavy trial of fortitude, a matter of
      tears and anguish and blood. Mrs. Haldin had felt the pangs of her own
      generation. There was that enthusiast brother of hers&mdash;the officer
      they shot under Nicholas. A faintly ironic resignation is no armour for a
      vulnerable heart. Mrs. Haldin, struck at through her children, was bound
      to suffer afresh from the past, and to feel the anguish of the future. She
      was of those who do not know how to heal themselves, of those who are too
      much aware of their heart, who, neither cowardly nor selfish, look
      passionately at its wounds&mdash;and count the cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such thoughts as these seasoned my modest, lonely bachelor&rsquo;s meal. If
      anybody wishes to remark that this was a roundabout way of thinking of
      Natalia Haldin, I can only retort that she was well worth some concern.
      She had all her life before her. Let it be admitted, then, that I was
      thinking of Natalia Haldin&rsquo;s life in terms of her mother&rsquo;s character, a
      manner of thinking about a girl permissible for an old man, not too old
      yet to have become a stranger to pity. There was almost all her youth
      before her; a youth robbed arbitrarily of its natural lightness and joy,
      overshadowed by an un-European despotism; a terribly sombre youth given
      over to the hazards of a furious strife between equally ferocious
      antagonisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lingered over my thoughts more than I should have done. One felt so
      helpless, and even worse&mdash;so unrelated, in a way. At the last moment
      I hesitated as to going there at all. What was the good?
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening was already advanced when, turning into the Boulevard des
      Philosophes, I saw the light in the window at the corner. The blind was
      down, but I could imagine behind it Mrs. Haldin seated in the chair, in
      her usual attitude, looking out for some one, which had lately acquired
      the poignant quality of mad expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that I was sufficiently authorized by the light to knock at the
      door. The ladies had not retired as yet. I only hoped they would not have
      any visitors of their own nationality. A broken-down, retired Russian
      official was to be found there sometimes in the evening. He was infinitely
      forlorn and wearisome by his mere dismal presence. I think these ladies
      tolerated his frequent visits because of an ancient friendship with Mr.
      Haldin, the father, or something of that sort. I made up my mind that if I
      found him prosing away there in his feeble voice I should remain but a
      very few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door surprised me by swinging open before I could ring the bell. I was
      confronted by Miss Haldin, in hat and jacket, obviously on the point of
      going out. At that hour! For the doctor, perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her exclamation of welcome reassured me. It sounded as if I had been the
      very man she wanted to see. My curiosity was awakened. She drew me in, and
      the faithful Anna, the elderly German maid, closed the door, but did not
      go away afterwards. She remained near it as if in readiness to let me out
      presently. It appeared that Miss Haldin had been on the point of going out
      to find me.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in a hurried manner very unusual with her. She would have gone
      straight and rung at Mrs. Ziegler&rsquo;s door, late as it was, for Mrs.
      Ziegler&rsquo;s habits....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ziegler, the widow of a distinguished professor who was an intimate
      friend of mine, lets me have three rooms out of her very large and fine
      apartment, which she didn&rsquo;t give up after her husband&rsquo;s death; but I have
      my own entrance opening on the same landing. It was an arrangement of at
      least ten years&rsquo; standing. I said that I was very glad that I had the idea
      to....
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin made no motion to take off her outdoor things. I observed her
      heightened colour, something pronouncedly resolute in her tone. Did I know
      where Mr. Razumov lived?
    </p>
    <p>
      Where Mr. Razumov lived? Mr. Razumov? At this hour&mdash;so urgently? I
      threw my arms up in sign of utter ignorance. I had not the slightest idea
      where he lived. If I could have foreseen her question only three hours
      ago, I might have ventured to ask him on the pavement before the new post
      office building, and possibly he would have told me, but very possibly,
      too, he would have dismissed me rudely to mind my own business. And
      possibly, I thought, remembering that extraordinary hallucined, anguished,
      and absent expression, he might have fallen down in a fit from the shock
      of being spoken to. I said nothing of all this to Miss Haldin, not even
      mentioning that I had a glimpse of the young man so recently. The
      impression had been so extremely unpleasant that I would have been glad to
      forget it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where I could make inquiries,&rdquo; I murmured helplessly. I would
      have been glad to be of use in any way, and would have set off to fetch
      any man, young or old, for I had the greatest confidence in her common
      sense. &ldquo;What made you think of coming to me for that information?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly for that,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice. She had the air of
      some one confronted by an unpleasant task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand that you must communicate with Mr. Razumov this
      evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalia Haldin moved her head affirmatively; then, after a glance at the
      door of the drawing-room, said in French&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est maman</i>,&rdquo; and remained perplexed for a moment. Always serious,
      not a girl to be put out by any imaginary difficulties, my curiosity was
      suspended on her lips, which remained closed for a moment. What was Mr.
      Razumov&rsquo;s connexion with this mention of her mother? Mrs. Haldin had not
      been informed of her son&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s arrival in Geneva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I hope to see your mother this evening?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin extended her hand as if to bar the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is in a terrible state of agitation. Oh, you would not he able to
      detect.... It&rsquo;s inward, but I who know mother, I am appalled. I haven&rsquo;t
      the courage to face it any longer. It&rsquo;s all my fault; I suppose I cannot
      play a part; I&rsquo;ve never before hidden anything from mother. There has
      never been an occasion for anything of that sort between us. But you know
      yourself the reason why I refrained from telling her at once of Mr.
      Razumov&rsquo;s arrival here. You understand, don&rsquo;t you? Owing to her unhappy
      state. And&mdash;there&mdash;I am no actress. My own feelings being
      strongly engaged, I somehow.... I don&rsquo;t know. She noticed something in my
      manner. She thought I was concealing something from her. She noticed my
      longer absences, and, in fact, as I have been meeting Mr. Razumov daily, I
      used to stay away longer than usual when I went out. Goodness knows what
      suspicions arose in her mind. You know that she has not been herself ever
      since.... So this evening she&mdash;who has been so awfully silent: for
      weeks-began to talk all at once. She said that she did not want to
      reproach me; that I had my character as she had her own; that she did not
      want to pry into my affairs or even into my thoughts; for her part, she
      had never had anything to conceal from her children...cruel things to
      listen to. And all this in her quiet voice, with that poor, wasted face as
      calm as a stone. It was unbearable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin talked in an undertone and more rapidly than I had ever heard
      her speak before. That in itself was disturbing. The ante-room being
      strongly lighted, I could see under the veil the heightened colour of her
      face. She stood erect, her left hand was resting lightly on a small table.
      The other hung by her side without stirring. Now and then she caught her
      breath slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was too startling. Just fancy! She thought that I was making
      preparations to leave her without saying anything. I knelt by the side of
      her chair and entreated her to think of what she was saying! She put her
      hand on my head, but she persists in her delusion all the same. She had
      always thought that she was worthy of her children&rsquo;s confidence, but
      apparently it was not so. Her son could not trust her love nor yet her
      understanding&mdash;and now I was planning to abandon her in the same
      cruel and unjust manner, and so on, and so on. Nothing I could say.... It
      is morbid obstinacy.... She said that she felt there was something, some
      change in me.... If my convictions were calling me away, why this secrecy,
      as though she had been a coward or a weakling not safe to trust? &lsquo;As if my
      heart could play traitor to my children,&rsquo; she said.... It was hardly to be
      borne. And she was smoothing my head all the time.... It was perfectly
      useless to protest. She is ill. Her very soul is....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not venture to break the silence which fell between us. I looked
      into her eyes, glistening through the veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! Changed!&rdquo; she exclaimed in the same low tone. &ldquo;My convictions calling
      me away! It was cruel to hear this, because my trouble is that I am weak
      and cannot see what I ought to do. You know that. And to end it all I did
      a selfish thing. To remove her suspicions of myself I told her of Mr.
      Razumov. It was selfish of me. You know we were completely right in
      agreeing to keep the knowledge away from her. Perfectly right. Directly I
      told her of our poor Victor&rsquo;s friend being here I saw how right we have
      been. She ought to have been prepared; but in my distress I just blurted
      it out. Mother got terribly excited at once. How long has he been here?
      What did he know, and why did he not come to see us at once, this friend
      of her Victor? What did that mean? Was she not to be trusted even with
      such memories as there were left of her son?... Just think how I felt
      seeing her, white like a sheet, perfectly motionless, with her thin hands
      gripping the arms of the chair. I told her it was all my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could imagine the motionless dumb figure of the mother in her chair,
      there, behind the door, near which the daughter was talking to me. The
      silence in there seemed to call aloud for vengeance against an historical
      fact and the modern instances of its working. That view flashed through my
      mind, but I could not doubt that Miss Haldin had had an atrocious time of
      it. I quite understood when she said that she could not face the night
      upon the impression of that scene. Mrs. Haldin had given way to most awful
      imaginings, to most fantastic and cruel suspicions. All this had to be
      lulled at all costs and without loss of time. It was no shock to me to
      learn that Miss Haldin had said to her, &ldquo;I will go and bring him here at
      once.&rdquo; There was nothing absurd in that cry, no exaggeration of sentiment.
      I was not even doubtful in my &ldquo;Very well, but how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly right that she should think of me, but what could I do in
      my ignorance of Mr. Razumov&rsquo;s quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think he may be living near by, within a stone&rsquo;s-throw, perhaps!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I doubted it; but I would have gone off cheerfully to fetch him from the
      other end of Geneva. I suppose she was certain of my readiness, since her
      first thought was to come to me. But the service she meant to ask of me
      really was to accompany her to the Chateau Borel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had an unpleasant mental vision of the dark road, of the sombre grounds,
      and the desolately suspicious aspect of that home of necromancy and
      intrigue and feminist adoration. I objected that Madame de S&mdash; most
      likely would know nothing of what we wanted to find out. Neither did I
      think it likely that the young man would be found there. I remembered my
      glimpse of his face, and somehow gained the conviction that a man who
      looked worse than if he had seen the dead would want to shut himself up
      somewhere where he could be alone. I felt a strange certitude that Mr.
      Razumov was going home when I saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really of Peter Ivanovitch that I was thinking,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! He, of course, would know. I looked at my watch. It was twenty minutes
      past nine only.... Still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would try his hotel, then,&rdquo; I advised. &ldquo;He has rooms at the
      Cosmopolitan, somewhere on the top floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not offer to go by myself, simply from mistrust of the reception I
      should meet with. But I suggested the faithful Anna, with a note asking
      for the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna was still waiting by the door at the other end of the room, and we
      two discussed the matter in whispers. Miss Haldin thought she must go
      herself. Anna was timid and slow. Time would be lost in bringing back the
      answer, and from that point of view it was getting late, for it was by no
      means certain that Mr. Razumov lived near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I go myself,&rdquo; Miss Haldin argued, &ldquo;I can go straight to him from the
      hotel. And in any case I should have to go out, because I must explain to
      Mr. Razumov personally&mdash;prepare him in a way. You have no idea of
      mother&rsquo;s state of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her colour came and went. She even thought that both for her mother&rsquo;s sake
      and for her own it was better that they should not be together for a
      little time. Anna, whom her mother liked, would be at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could take her sewing into the room,&rdquo; Miss Haldin continued, leading
      the way to the door. Then, addressing in German the maid who opened it
      before us, &ldquo;You may tell my mother that this gentleman called and is gone
      with me to find Mr. Razumov. She must not be uneasy if I am away for some
      length of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We passed out quickly into the street, and she took deep breaths of the
      cool night air. &ldquo;I did not even ask you,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; I said, with a laugh. The manner of my reception by
      the great feminist could not be considered now. That he would be annoyed
      to see me, and probably treat me to some solemn insolence, I had no doubt,
      but I supposed that he would not absolutely dare to throw me out. And that
      was all I cared for. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take my arm?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did so in silence, and neither of us said anything worth recording
      till I let her go first into the great hall of the hotel. It was
      brilliantly lighted, and with a good many people lounging about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could very well go up there without you,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be left waiting in this place,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I led her straight to the lift then. At the top floor the attendant
      directed us to the right: &ldquo;End of the corridor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walls were white, the carpet red, electric lights blazed in profusion,
      and the emptiness, the silence, the closed doors all alike and numbered,
      made me think of the perfect order of some severely luxurious model
      penitentiary on the solitary confinement principle. Up there under the
      roof of that enormous pile for housing travellers no sound of any kind
      reached us, the thick crimson felt muffled our footsteps completely. We
      hastened on, not looking at each other till we found ourselves before the
      very last door of that long passage. Then our eyes met, and we stood thus
      for a moment lending ear to a faint murmur of voices inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose this is it,&rdquo; I whispered unnecessarily. I saw Miss Haldin&rsquo;s
      lips move without a sound, and after my sharp knock the murmur of voices
      inside ceased. A profound stillness lasted for a few seconds, and then the
      door was brusquely opened by a short, black-eyed woman in a red blouse,
      with a great lot of nearly white hair, done up negligently in an untidy
      and unpicturesque manner. Her thin, jetty eyebrows were drawn together. I
      learned afterwards with interest that she was the famous&mdash;or the
      notorious&mdash;Sophia Antonovna, but I was struck then by the quaint
      Mephistophelian character of her inquiring glance, because it was so
      curiously evil-less, so&mdash;I may say&mdash;un-devilish. It got softened
      still more as she looked up at Miss Haldin, who stated, in her rich, even
      voice, her wish to see Peter Ivanovitch for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Miss Haldin,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, with her brow completely smoothed out now, but without a word in
      answer, the woman in the red blouse walked away to a sofa and sat down,
      leaving the door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the sofa, her hands lying on her lap, she watched us enter, with
      her black, glittering eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin advanced into the middle of the room; I, faithful to my part
      of mere attendant, remained by the door after closing it behind me. The
      room, quite a large one, but with a low ceiling, was scantily furnished,
      and an electric bulb with a porcelain shade pulled low down over a big
      table (with a very large map spread on it) left its distant parts in a
      dim, artificial twilight. Peter Ivanovitch was not to be seen, neither was
      Mr. Razumov present. But, on the sofa, near Sophia Antonovna, a bony-faced
      man with a goatee beard leaned forward with his hands on his knees,
      staring hard with a kindly expression. In a remote corner a broad, pale
      face and a bulky shape could be made out, uncouth, and as if insecure on
      the low seat on which it rested. The only person known to me was little
      Julius Laspara, who seemed to have been poring over the map, his feet
      twined tightly round the chair-legs. He got down briskly and bowed to Miss
      Haldin, looking absurdly like a hooknosed boy with a beautiful false
      pepper-and-salt beard. He advanced, offering his seat, which Miss Haldin
      declined. She had only come in for a moment to say a few words to Peter
      Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      His high-pitched voice became painfully audible in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strangely enough, I was thinking of you this very afternoon, Natalia
      Victorovna. I met Mr. Razumov. I asked him to write me an article on
      anything he liked. You could translate it into English&mdash;with such a
      teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded complimentarily in my direction. At the name of Razumov an
      indescribable sound, a sort of feeble squeak, as of some angry small
      animal, was heard in the corner occupied by the man who seemed much too
      large for the chair on which he sat. I did not hear what Miss Haldin said.
      Laspara spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to do something, Natalia Victorovna. But I suppose you have
      your own ideas. Why not write something yourself? Suppose you came to see
      us soon? We could talk it over. Any advice...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again I did not catch Miss Haldin&rsquo;s words. It was Laspara&rsquo;s voice once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch? He&rsquo;s retired for a moment into the other room. We are
      all waiting for him.&rdquo; The great man, entering at that moment, looked
      bigger, taller, quite imposing in a long dressing-gown of some dark stuff.
      It descended in straight lines down to his feet. He suggested a monk or a
      prophet, a robust figure of same desert-dweller&mdash;something Asiatic;
      and the dark glasses in conjunction with this costume made him more
      mysterious than ever in the subdued light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Laspara went back to his chair to look at the map, the only
      brilliantly lit object in the room. Even from my distant position by the
      door I could make out, by the shape of the blue part representing the
      water, that it was a map of the Baltic provinces. Peter Ivanovitch
      exclaimed slightly, advancing towards Miss Haldin, checked himself on
      perceiving me, very vaguely no doubt; and peered with his dark,
      bespectacled stare. He must have recognized me by my grey hair, because,
      with a marked shrug of his broad shoulders, he turned to Miss Haldin in
      benevolent indulgence. He seized her hand in his thick cushioned palm, and
      put his other big paw over it like a lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      While those two standing in the middle of the floor were exchanging a few
      inaudible phrases no one else moved in the room: Laspara, with his back to
      us, kneeling on the chair, his elbows propped on the big-scale map, the
      shadowy enormity in the corner, the frankly staring man with the goatee on
      the sofa, the woman in the red blouse by his side&mdash;not one of them
      stirred. I suppose that really they had no time, for Miss Haldin withdrew
      her hand immediately from Peter Ivanovitch and before I was ready for her
      was moving to the door. A disregarded Westerner, I threw it open hurriedly
      and followed her out, my last glance leaving them all motionless in their
      varied poses: Peter Ivanovitch alone standing up, with his dark glasses
      like an enormous blind teacher, and behind him the vivid patch of light on
      the coloured map, pored over by the diminutive Laspara.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, much later on, at the time of the newspaper rumours (they were
      vague and soon died out) of an abortive military conspiracy in Russia, I
      remembered the glimpse I had of that motionless group with its central
      figure. No details ever came out, but it was known that the revolutionary
      parties abroad had given their assistance, had sent emissaries in advance,
      that even money was found to dispatch a steamer with a cargo of arms and
      conspirators to invade the Baltic provinces. And while my eyes scanned the
      imperfect disclosures (in which the world was not much interested) I
      thought that the old, settled Europe had been given in my person attending
      that Russian girl something like a glimpse behind the scenes. A short,
      strange glimpse on the top floor of a great hotel of all places in the
      world: the great man himself; the motionless great bulk in the corner of
      the slayer of spies and gendarmes; Yakovlitch, the veteran of ancient
      terrorist campaigns; the woman, with her hair as white as mine and the
      lively black eyes, all in a mysterious half-light, with the strongly
      lighted map of Russia on the table. The woman I had the opportunity to see
      again. As we were waiting for the lift she came hurrying along the
      corridor, with her eyes fastened on Miss Haldin&rsquo;s face, and drew her aside
      as if for a confidential communication. It was not long. A few words only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going down in the lift, Natalia Haldin did not break the silence. It was
      only when out of the hotel and as we moved along the quay in the fresh
      darkness spangled by the quay lights, reflected in the black water of the
      little port on our left hand, and with lofty piles of hotels on our right,
      that she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Sophia Antonovna&mdash;you know the woman?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;the famous...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same. It appears that after we went out Peter Ivanovitch told them
      why I had come. That was the reason she ran out after us. She named
      herself to me, and then she said, &lsquo;You are the sister of a brave man who
      shall be remembered. You may see better times.&rsquo; I told her I hoped to see
      the time when all this would be forgotten, even if the name of my brother
      were to be forgotten too. Something moved me to say that, but you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You think of the era of concord and justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There is too much hate and revenge in that work. It must be done. It
      is a sacrifice&mdash;and so let it be all the greater. Destruction is the
      work of anger. Let the tyrants and the slayers be forgotten together, and
      only the reconstructors be remembered.&lsquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did Sophia Antonovna agree with you?&rdquo; I asked sceptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not say anything except, &lsquo;It is good for you to believe in love.&rsquo; 
      I should think she understood me. Then she asked me if I hoped to see Mr.
      Razumov presently. I said I trusted I could manage to bring him to see my
      mother this evening, as my mother had learned of his being here and was
      morbidly impatient to learn if he could tell us something of Victor. He
      was the only friend of my brother we knew of, and a great intimate. She
      said, &lsquo;Oh! Your brother&mdash;yes. Please tell Mr. Razumov that I have
      made public the story which came to me from St. Petersburg. It concerns
      your brother&rsquo;s arrest,&rsquo; she added. &lsquo;He was betrayed by a man of the people
      who has since hanged himself. Mr. Razumov will explain it all to you. I
      gave him the full information this afternoon. And please tell Mr. Razumov
      that Sophia Antonovna sends him her greetings. I am going away early in
      the morning&mdash;far away.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Haldin added, after a moment of silence&mdash;&ldquo;I was so moved by
      what I heard so unexpectedly that I simply could not speak to you
      before.... A man of the people! Oh, our poor people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked slowly, as if tired out suddenly. Her head drooped; from the
      windows of a building with terraces and balconies came the banal sound of
      hotel music; before the low mean portals of the Casino two red posters
      blazed under the electric lamps, with a cheap provincial effect.&mdash;and
      the emptiness of the quays, the desert aspect of the streets, had an air
      of hypocritical respectability and of inexpressible dreariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had taken for granted she had obtained the address, and let myself be
      guided by her. On the Mont Blanc bridge, where a few dark figures seemed
      lost in the wide and long perspective defined by the lights, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very far from our house. I somehow thought it couldn&rsquo;t be. The
      address is Rue de Carouge. I think it must be one of those big new houses
      for artisans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my arm confidingly, familiarly, and accelerated her pace. There
      was something primitive in our proceedings. We did not think of the
      resources of civilization. A late tramcar overtook us; a row of <i>fiacres</i>
      stood by the railing of the gardens. It never entered our heads to make
      use of these conveyances. She was too hurried, perhaps, and as to myself&mdash;well,
      she had taken my arm confidingly. As we were ascending the easy incline of
      the Corraterie, all the shops shuttered and no light in any of the windows
      (as if all the mercenary population had fled at the end of the day), she
      said tentatively&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could run in for a moment to have a look at mother. It would not be
      much out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I dissuaded her. If Mrs. Haldin really expected to see Razumov that night
      it would have been unwise to show herself without him. The sooner we got
      hold of the young man and brought him along to calm her mother&rsquo;s agitation
      the better. She assented to my reasoning, and we crossed diagonally the
      Place de Theatre, bluish grey with its floor of slabs of stone, under the
      electric light, and the lonely equestrian statue all black in the middle.
      In the Rue de Carouge we were in the poorer quarters and approaching the
      outskirts of the town. Vacant building plots alternated with high, new
      houses. At the corner of a side street the crude light of a whitewashed
      shop fell into the night, fan-like, through a wide doorway. One could see
      from a distance the inner wall with its scantily furnished shelves, and
      the deal counter painted brown. That was the house. Approaching it along
      the dark stretch of a fence of tarred planks, we saw the narrow pallid
      face of the cut angle, five single windows high, without a gleam in them,
      and crowned by the heavy shadow of a jutting roof slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must inquire in the shop,&rdquo; Miss Haldin directed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sallow, thinly whiskered man, wearing a dingy white collar and a frayed
      tie, laid down a newspaper, and, leaning familiarly on both elbows far
      over the bare counter, answered that the person I was inquiring for was
      indeed his <i>locataire</i> on the third floor, but that for the moment he
      was out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the moment,&rdquo; I repeated, after a glance at Miss Haldin. &ldquo;Does this
      mean that you expect him back at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very gentle, with ingratiating eyes and soft lips. He smiled
      faintly as though he knew all about everything. Mr. Razumov, after being
      absent all day, had returned early in the evening. He was very surprised
      about half an hour or a little more since to see him come down again. Mr.
      Razumov left his key, and in the course of some words which passed between
      them had remarked that he was going out because he needed air.
    </p>
    <p>
      From behind the bare counter he went on smiling at us, his head held
      between his hands. Air. Air. But whether that meant a long or a short
      absence it was difficult to say. The night was very close, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, his ingratiating eyes turned to the door, he added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm shall drive him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a storm?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if to confirm his words we heard a very distant, deep rumbling noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consulting Miss Haldin by a glance, I saw her so reluctant to give up her
      quest that I asked the shopkeeper, in case Mr. Razumov came home within
      half an hour, to beg him to remain downstairs in the shop. We would look
      in again presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all answer he moved his head imperceptibly. The approval of Miss
      Haldin was expressed by her silence. We walked slowly down the street,
      away from the town; the low garden walls of the modest villas doomed to
      demolition were overhung by the boughs of trees and masses of foliage,
      lighted from below by gas lamps. The violent and monotonous noise of the
      icy waters of the Arve falling over a low dam swept towards us with a
      chilly draught of air across a great open space, where a double line of
      lamp-lights outlined a street as yet without houses. But on the other
      shore, overhung by the awful blackness of the thunder-cloud, a solitary
      dim light seemed to watch us with a weary stare. When we had strolled as
      far as the bridge, I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had better get back....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the shop the sickly man was studying his smudgy newspaper, now spread
      out largely on the counter. He just raised his head when I looked in and
      shook it negatively, pursing up his lips. I rejoined Miss Haldin outside
      at once, and we moved off at a brisk pace. She remarked that she would
      send Anna with a note the first thing in the morning. I respected her
      taciturnity, silence being perhaps the best way to show my concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The semi-rural street we followed on our return changed gradually to the
      usual town thoroughfare, broad and deserted. We did not meet four people
      altogether, and the way seemed interminable, because my companion&rsquo;s
      natural anxiety had communicated itself sympathetically to me. At last we
      turned into the Boulevard des Philosophes, more wide, more empty, more
      dead&mdash;the very desolation of slumbering respectability. At the sight
      of the two lighted windows, very conspicuous from afar, I had the mental
      vision of Mrs. Haldin in her armchair keeping a dreadful, tormenting vigil
      under the evil spell of an arbitrary rule: a victim of tyranny and
      revolution, a sight at once cruel and absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come in for a moment?&rdquo; said Natalia Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I demurred on account of the late hour. &ldquo;You know mother likes you so
      much,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will just come in to hear how your mother is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said, as if to herself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know whether she will believe
      that I could not find Mr. Razumov, since she has taken it into her head
      that I am concealing something from her. You may be able to persuade
      her....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother may mistrust me too,&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Why? What could you have to conceal from her? You are not a Russian
      nor a conspirator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt profoundly my European remoteness, and said nothing, but I made up
      my mind to play my part of helpless spectator to the end. The distant
      rolling of thunder in the valley of the Rhone was coming nearer to the
      sleeping town of prosaic virtues and universal hospitality. We crossed the
      street opposite the great dark gateway, and Miss Haldin rang at the door
      of the apartment. It was opened almost instantly, as if the elderly maid
      had been waiting in the ante-room for our return. Her flat physiognomy had
      an air of satisfaction. The gentleman was there, she declared, while
      closing the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of us understood. Miss Haldin turned round brusquely to her.
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Razumov,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had heard enough of our conversation before we left to know why her
      young mistress was going out. Therefore, when the gentleman gave his name
      at the door, she admitted him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could have foreseen that,&rdquo; Miss Haldin murmured, with her serious
      grey eyes fixed upon mine. And, remembering the expression of the young
      man&rsquo;s face seen not much more than four hours ago, the look of a haunted
      somnambulist, I wondered with a sort of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked my mother first?&rdquo; Miss Haldin inquired of the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I announced the gentleman,&rdquo; she answered, surprised at our troubled
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; I said in an undertone, &ldquo;your mother was prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But he has no idea....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me she doubted his tact. To her question how long the
      gentleman had been with her mother, the maid told us that Der Herr had
      been in the drawing-room no more than a short quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited a moment, then withdrew, looking a little scared. Miss Haldin
      gazed at me in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As things have turned out,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you happen to know exactly what your
      brother&rsquo;s friend has to tell your mother. And surely after that...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Natalia Haldin slowly. &ldquo;I only wonder, as I was not here when
      he came, if it wouldn&rsquo;t be better not to interrupt now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We remained silent, and I suppose we both strained our ears, but no sound
      reached us through the closed door. The features of Miss Haldin expressed
      a painful irresolution; she made a movement as if to go in, but checked
      herself. She had heard footsteps on the other side of the door. It came
      open, and Razumov, without pausing, stepped out into the ante-room. The
      fatigue of that day and the struggle with himself had changed him so much
      that I would have hesitated to recognize that face which, only a few hours
      before, when he brushed against me in front of the post office, had been
      startling enough but quite different. It had been not so livid then, and
      its eyes not so sombre. They certainly looked more sane now, but there was
      upon them the shadow of something consciously evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I speak of that, because, at first, their glance fell on me, though
      without any sort of recognition or even comprehension. I was simply in the
      line of his stare. I don&rsquo;t know if he had heard the bell or expected to
      see anybody. He was going out, I believe, and I do not think that he saw
      Miss Haldin till she advanced towards him a step or two. He disregarded
      the hand she put out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Natalia Victorovna.... Perhaps you are surprised...at this late
      hour. But, you see, I remembered our conversations in that garden. I
      thought really it was your wish that I should&mdash;without loss of
      time...so I came. No other reason. Simply to tell...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with difficulty. I noticed that, and remembered his declaration
      to the man in the shop that he was going out because he &ldquo;needed air.&rdquo; If
      that was his object, then it was clear that he had miserably failed. With
      downcast eyes and lowered head he made an effort to pick up the strangled
      phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell what I have heard myself only to-day&mdash;to-day....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the door he had not closed I had a view of the drawing-room. It
      was lighted only by a shaded lamp&mdash;Mrs. Haldin&rsquo;s eyes could not
      support either gas or electricity. It was a comparatively big room, and in
      contrast with the strongly lighted ante-room its length was lost in
      semi-transparent gloom backed by heavy shadows; and on that ground I saw
      the motionless figure of Mrs. Haldin, inclined slightly forward, with a
      pale hand resting on the arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not move. With the window before her she had no longer that
      attitude suggesting expectation. The blind was down; and outside there was
      only the night sky harbouring a thunder-cloud, and the town indifferent
      and hospitable in its cold, almost scornful, toleration&mdash;a
      respectable town of refuge to which all these sorrows and hopes were
      nothing. Her white head was bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought that the real drama of autocracy is not played on the great
      stage of politics came to me as, fated to be a spectator, I had this other
      glimpse behind the scenes, something more profound than the words and
      gestures of the public play. I had the certitude that this mother, refused
      in her heart to give her son up after all. It was more than Rachel&rsquo;s
      inconsolable mourning, it was something deeper, more inaccessible in its
      frightful tranquillity. Lost in the ill-defined mass of the high-backed
      chair, her white, inclined profile suggested the contemplation of
      something in her lap, as though a beloved head were resting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had this glimpse behind the scenes, and then Miss Haldin, passing by the
      young man, shut the door. It was not done without hesitation. For a moment
      I thought that she would go to her mother, but she sent in only an anxious
      glance. Perhaps if Mrs. Haldin had moved...but no. There was in the
      immobility of that bloodless face the dreadful aloofness of suffering
      without remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the young man kept his eyes fixed on the floor. The thought that
      he would have to repeat the story he had told already was intolerable to
      him. He had expected to find the two women together. And then, he had said
      to himself, it would be over for all time&mdash;for all time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky
      I don&rsquo;t believe in another world,&rdquo; he had thought cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in his room after having posted his secret letter, he had regained a
      certain measure of composure by writing in his secret diary. He was aware
      of the danger of that strange self-indulgence. He alludes to it himself,
      but he could not refrain. It calmed him&mdash;it reconciled him to his
      existence. He sat there scribbling by the light of a solitary candle, till
      it occurred to him that having heard the explanation of Haldin&rsquo;s arrest,
      as put forward by Sophia Antonovna, it behoved him to tell these ladies
      himself. They were certain to hear the tale through some other channel,
      and then his abstention would look strange, not only to the mother and
      sister of Haldin, but to other people also. Having come to this
      conclusion, he did not discover in himself any marked reluctance to face
      the necessity, and very soon an anxiety to be done with it began to
      torment him. He looked at his watch. No; it was not absolutely too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifteen minutes with Mrs. Haldin were like the revenge of the unknown:
      that white face, that weak, distinct voice; that head, at first turned to
      him eagerly, then, after a while, bowed again and motionless&mdash;in the
      dim, still light of the room in which his words which he tried to subdue
      resounded so loudly&mdash;had troubled him like some strange discovery.
      And there seemed to be a secret obstinacy in that sorrow, something he
      could not understand; at any rate, something he had not expected. Was it
      hostile? But it did not matter. Nothing could touch him now; in the eyes
      of the revolutionists there was now no shadow on his past. The phantom of
      Haldin had been indeed walked over, was left behind lying powerless and
      passive on the pavement covered with snow. And this was the phantom&rsquo;s
      mother consumed with grief and white as a ghost. He had felt a pitying
      surprise. But that, of course, was of no importance. Mothers did not
      matter. He could not shake off the poignant impression of that silent,
      quiet, white-haired woman, but a sort of sternness crept into his
      thoughts. These were the consequences. Well, what of it? &ldquo;Am I then on a
      bed of roses?&rdquo; he had exclaimed to himself, sitting at some distance with
      his eyes fixed upon that figure of sorrow. He had said all he had to say
      to her, and when he had finished she had not uttered a word. She had
      turned away her head while he was speaking. The silence which had fallen
      on his last words had lasted for five minutes or more. What did it mean?
      Before its incomprehensible character he became conscious of anger in his
      stern mood, the old anger against Haldin reawakened by the contemplation
      of Haldin&rsquo;s mother. And was it not something like enviousness which
      gripped his heart, as if of a privilege denied to him alone of all the men
      that had ever passed through this world? It was the other who had attained
      to repose and yet continued to exist in the affection of that mourning old
      woman, in the thoughts of all these people posing for lovers of humanity.
      It was impossible to get rid of him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s myself whom I have given up to
      destruction,&rdquo; thought Razumov. &ldquo;He has induced me to do it. I can&rsquo;t shake
      him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed by that discovery, he got up and strode out of the silent, dim
      room with its silent old woman in the chair, that mother! He never looked
      back. It was frankly a flight. But on opening the door he saw his retreat
      cut off: There was the sister. He had never forgotten the sister, only he
      had not expected to see her then&mdash;or ever any more, perhaps. Her
      presence in the ante-room was as unforeseen as the apparition of her
      brother had been. Razumov gave a start as though he had discovered himself
      cleverly trapped. He tried to smile, but could not manage it, and lowered
      his eyes. &ldquo;Must I repeat that silly story now?&rdquo; he asked himself, and felt
      a sinking sensation. Nothing solid had passed his lips since the day
      before, but he was not in a state to analyse the origins of his weakness.
      He meant to take up his hat and depart with as few words as possible, but
      Miss Haldin&rsquo;s swift movement to shut the door took him by surprise. He
      half turned after her, but without raising his eyes, passively, just as a
      feather might stir in the disturbed air. The next moment she was back in
      the place she had started from, with another half-turn on his part, so
      that they came again into the same relative positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;I am very grateful to you, Kirylo
      Sidorovitch, for coming at once&mdash;like this.... Only, I wish I had....
      Did mother tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what she could have told me that I did not know before,&rdquo; he
      said, obviously to himself, but perfectly audible. &ldquo;Because I always did
      know it,&rdquo; he added louder, as if in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung his head. He had such a strong sense of Natalia Haldin&rsquo;s presence
      that to look at her he felt would be a relief. It was she who had been
      haunting him now. He had suffered that persecution ever since she had
      suddenly appeared before him in the garden of the Villa Borel with an
      extended hand and the name of her brother on her lips.... The ante-room
      had a row of hooks on the wall nearest to the outer door, while against
      the wall opposite there stood a small dark table and one chair. The paper,
      bearing a very faint design, was all but white. The light of an electric
      bulb high up under the ceiling searched that clear square box into its
      four bare corners, crudely, without shadows&mdash;a strange stage for an
      obscure drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Miss Haldin. &ldquo;What is it that you knew always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his face, pale, full of unexpressed suffering. But that look in
      his eyes of dull, absent obstinacy, which struck and surprised everybody
      he was talking to, began to pass way. It was as though he were coming to
      himself in the awakened consciousness of that marvellous harmony of
      feature, of lines, of glances, of voice, which made of the girl before him
      a being so rare, outside, and, as it were, above the common notion of
      beauty. He looked at her so long that she coloured slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you knew?&rdquo; she repeated vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      That time he managed to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, if it had not been for a word of greeting or two, I would doubt
      whether your mother was aware at all of my existence. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natalia Haldin nodded; her hands moved slightly by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is it not heart-breaking? She has not shed a tear yet&mdash;not a
      single tear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a tear! And you, Natalia Victorovna? You have been able to cry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. And then I am young enough, Kirylo Sidorovitch, to believe in the
      future. But when I see my mother so terribly distracted, I almost forget
      everything. I ask myself whether one should feel proud&mdash;or only
      resigned. We had such a lot of people coming to see us. There were utter
      strangers who wrote asking for permission to call to present their
      respects. It was impossible to keep our door shut for ever. You know that
      Peter Ivanovitch himself.... Oh yes, there was much sympathy, but there
      were persons who exulted openly at that death. Then, when I was left alone
      with poor mother, all this seemed so wrong in spirit, something not worth
      the price she is paying for it. But directly I heard you were here in
      Geneva, Kirylo Sidorovitch, I felt that you were the only person who could
      assist me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In comforting a bereaved mother? Yes!&rdquo; he broke in in a manner which made
      her open her clear unsuspecting eyes. &ldquo;But there is a question of fitness.
      Has this occurred to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathlessness in his utterance which contrasted with the
      monstrous hint of mockery in his intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; whispered Natalia Haldin with feeling. &ldquo;Who more fit than you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a convulsive movement of exasperation, but controlled himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Directly you heard that I was in Geneva, before even seeing me?
      It is another proof of that confidence which....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once his tone changed, became more incisive and more detached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are poor creatures, Natalia Victorovna. They have no intuition of
      sentiment. In order to speak fittingly to a mother of her lost son one
      must have had some experience of the filial relation. It is not the case
      with me&mdash;if you must know the whole truth. Your hopes have to deal
      here with &lsquo;a breast unwarmed by any affection,&rsquo; as the poet says.... That
      does not mean it is insensible,&rdquo; he added in a lower tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain your heart is not unfeeling,&rdquo; said Miss Haldin softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is not as hard as a stone,&rdquo; he went on in the same introspective
      voice, and looking as if his heart were lying as heavy as a stone in that
      unwarmed breast of which he spoke. &ldquo;No, not so hard. But how to prove what
      you give me credit for&mdash;ah! that&rsquo;s another question. No one has ever
      expected such a thing from me before. No one whom my tenderness would have
      been of any use to. And now you come. You! Now! No, Natalia Victorovna.
      It&rsquo;s too late. You come too late. You must expect nothing from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recoiled from him a little, though he had made no movement, as if she
      had seen some change in his face, charging his words with the significance
      of some hidden sentiment they shared together. To me, the silent
      spectator, they looked like two people becoming conscious of a spell which
      had been lying on them ever since they first set eyes on each other. Had
      either of them cast a glance then in my direction, I would have opened the
      door quietly and gone out. But neither did; and I remained, every fear of
      indiscretion lost in the sense of my enormous remoteness from their
      captivity within the sombre horizon of Russian problems, the boundary of
      their eyes, of their feelings&mdash;the prison of their souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank, courageous, Miss Haldin controlled her voice in the midst of her
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can this mean?&rdquo; she asked, as if speaking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may mean that you have given yourself up to vain imaginings while I
      have managed to remain amongst the truth of things and the realities of
      life&mdash;our Russian life&mdash;such as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are cruel,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ugly. Don&rsquo;t forget that&mdash;and ugly. Look where you like. Look
      near you, here abroad where you are, and then look back at home, whence
      you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must look beyond the present.&rdquo; Her tone had an ardent conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blind can do that best. I have had the misfortune to be born
      clear-eyed. And if you only knew what strange things I have seen! What
      amazing and unexpected apparitions!... But why talk of all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I want to talk of all this with you,&rdquo; she protested with
      earnest serenity. The sombre humours of her brother&rsquo;s friend left her
      unaffected, as though that bitterness, that suppressed anger, were the
      signs of an indignant rectitude. She saw that he was not an ordinary
      person, and perhaps she did not want him to be other than he appeared to
      her trustful eyes. &ldquo;Yes, with you especially,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;With you of
      all the Russian people in the world....&rdquo; A faint smile dwelt for a moment
      on her lips. &ldquo;I am like poor mother in a way. I too seem unable to give up
      our beloved dead, who, don&rsquo;t forget, was all in all to us. I don&rsquo;t want to
      abuse your sympathy, but you must understand that it is in you that we can
      find all that is left of his generous soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was looking at him; not a muscle of his face moved in the least. And
      yet, even at the time, I did not suspect him of insensibility. It was a
      sort of rapt thoughtfulness. Then he stirred slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going, Kirylo Sidorovitch?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! Going? Where? Oh yes, but I must tell you first....&rdquo; His voice was
      muffled and he forced himself to produce it with visible repugnance, as if
      speech were something disgusting or deadly. &ldquo;That story, you know&mdash;the
      story I heard this afternoon....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the story already,&rdquo; she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it! Have you correspondents in St. Petersburg too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s Sophia Antonovna. I have seen her just now. She sends you her
      greetings. She is going away to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had lowered at last his fascinated glance; she too was looking down,
      and standing thus before each other in the glaring light, between the four
      bare walls, they seemed brought out from the confused immensity of the
      Eastern borders to be exposed cruelly to the observation of my Western
      eyes. And I observed them. There was nothing else to do. My existence
      seemed so utterly forgotten by these two that I dared not now make a
      movement. And I thought to myself that, of course, they had to come
      together, the sister and the friend of that dead man. The ideas, the
      hopes, the aspirations, the cause of Freedom, expressed in their common
      affection for Victor Haldin, the moral victim of autocracy,&mdash;all this
      must draw them to each other fatally. Her very ignorance and his
      loneliness to which he had alluded so strangely must work to that end.
      And, indeed, I saw that the work was done already. Of course. It was
      manifest that they must have been thinking of each other for a long time
      before they met. She had the letter from that beloved brother kindling her
      imagination by the severe praise attached to that one name; and for him to
      see that exceptional girl was enough. The only cause for surprise was his
      gloomy aloofness before her clearly expressed welcome. But he was young,
      and however austere and devoted to his revolutionary ideals, he was not
      blind. The period of reserve was over; he was coming forward in his own
      way. I could not mistake the significance of this late visit, for in what
      he had to say there was nothing urgent. The true cause dawned upon me: he
      had discovered that he needed her and she was moved by the same feeling.
      It was the second time that I saw them together, and I knew that next time
      they met I would not be there, either remembered or forgotten. I would
      have virtually ceased to exist for both these young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made this discovery in a very few moments. Meantime, Natalia Haldin was
      telling Razumov briefly of our peregrinations from one end of Geneva to
      the other. While speaking she raised her hands above her head to untie her
      veil, and that movement displayed for an instant the seductive grace of
      her youthful figure, clad in the simplest of mourning. In the transparent
      shadow the hat rim threw on her face her grey eyes had an enticing lustre.
      Her voice, with its unfeminine yet exquisite timbre, was steady, and she
      spoke quickly, frank, unembarrassed. As she justified her action by the
      mental state of her mother, a spasm of pain marred the generously
      confiding harmony of her features. I perceived that with his downcast eyes
      he had the air of a man who is listening to a strain of music rather than
      to articulated speech. And in the same way, after she had ceased, he
      seemed to listen yet, motionless, as if under the spell of suggestive
      sound. He came to himself, muttering&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. She has not shed a tear. She did not seem to hear what I was
      saying. I might have told her anything. She looked as if no longer
      belonging to this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin gave signs of profound distress. Her voice faltered. &ldquo;You
      don&rsquo;t know how bad it has come to be. She expects now to see <i>him</i>!&rdquo;
       The veil dropped from her fingers and she clasped her hands in anguish.
      &ldquo;It shall end by her seeing him,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov raised his head sharply and attached on her a prolonged thoughtful
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. That&rsquo;s very possible,&rdquo; he muttered in a peculiar tone, as if giving
      his opinion on a matter of fact. &ldquo;I wonder what....&rdquo; He checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be the end. Her mind shall be gone then, and her spirit will
      follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin unclasped her hands and let them fall by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; he queried profoundly. Miss Haldin&rsquo;s lips were slightly
      parted. Something unexpected and unfathomable in that young man&rsquo;s
      character had fascinated her from the first. &ldquo;No! There&rsquo;s neither truth
      nor consolation to be got from the phantoms of the dead,&rdquo; he added after a
      weighty pause. &ldquo;I might have told her something true; for instance, that
      your brother meant to save his life&mdash;to escape. There can be no doubt
      of that. But I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not! But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Other thoughts came into my head,&rdquo; he answered. He seemed
      to me to be watching himself inwardly, as though he were trying to count
      his own heart-beats, while his eyes never for a moment left the face of
      the girl. &ldquo;You were not there,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I had made up my mind never
      to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to take her breath away for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You.... How is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well ask.... However, I think that I refrained from telling your
      mother from prudence. I might have assured her that in the last
      conversation he held as a free man he mentioned you both....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That last conversation was with you,&rdquo; she struck in her deep, moving
      voice. &ldquo;Some day you must....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was with me. Of you he said that you had trustful eyes. And why I have
      not been able to forget that phrase I don&rsquo;t know. It meant that there is
      in you no guile, no deception, no falsehood, no suspicion&mdash;nothing in
      your heart that could give you a conception of a living, acting, speaking
      lie, if ever it came in your way. That you are a predestined victim....
      Ha! what a devilish suggestion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convulsive, uncontrolled tone of the last words disclosed the
      precarious hold he had over himself. He was like a man defying his own
      dizziness in high places and tottering suddenly on the very edge of the
      precipice. Miss Haldin pressed her hand to her breast. The dropped black
      veil lay on the floor between them. Her movement steadied him. He looked
      intently on that hand till it descended slowly, and then raised again his
      eyes to her face. But he did not give her time to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? You don&rsquo;t understand? Very well.&rdquo; He had recovered his calm by a
      miracle of will. &ldquo;So you talked with Sophia Antonovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sophia Antonovna told me....&rdquo; Miss Haldin stopped, wonder growing in
      her wide eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. That&rsquo;s the respectable enemy,&rdquo; he muttered, as though he were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tone of her references to you was extremely friendly,&rdquo; remarked Miss
      Haldin, after waiting for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your impression? And she the most intelligent of the lot, too.
      Things then are going as well as possible. Everything conspires to...Ah!
      these conspirators,&rdquo; he said slowly, with an accent of scorn; &ldquo;they would
      get hold of you in no time! You know, Natalia Victorovna, I have the
      greatest difficulty in saving myself from the superstition of an active
      Providence. It&rsquo;s irresistible.... The alternative, of course, would be the
      personal Devil of our simple ancestors. But, if so, he has overdone it
      altogether&mdash;the old Father of Lies&mdash;our national patron&mdash;our
      domestic god, whom we take with us when we go abroad. He has overdone it.
      It seems that I am not simple enough.... That&rsquo;s it! I ought to have
      known.... And I did know it,&rdquo; he added in a tone of poignant distress
      which overcame my astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man is deranged,&rdquo; I said to myself, very much frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he gave me a very special impression beyond the range of
      commonplace definitions. It was as though he had stabbed himself outside
      and had come in there to show it; and more than that&mdash;as though he
      were turning the knife in the wound and watching the effect. That was the
      impression, rendered in physical terms. One could not defend oneself from
      a certain amount of pity. But it was for Miss Haldin, already so tried in
      her deepest affections, that I felt a serious concern. Her attitude, her
      face, expressed compassion struggling with doubt on the verge of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Kirylo Sidorovitch?&rdquo; There was a hint of tenderness in that
      cry. He only stared at her in that complete surrender of all his faculties
      which in a happy lover would have had the name of ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you looking at me like this, Kirylo Sidorovitch? I have
      approached you frankly. I need at this time to see clearly in myself....&rdquo;
       She ceased for a moment as if to give him an opportunity to utter at last
      some word worthy of her exalted trust in her brother&rsquo;s friend. His silence
      became impressive, like a sign of a momentous resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end Miss Haldin went on, appealingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have waited for you anxiously. But now that you have been moved to come
      to us in your kindness, you alarm me. You speak obscurely. It seems as if
      you were keeping back something from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Natalia Victorovna,&rdquo; he was heard at last in a strange unringing
      voice, &ldquo;whom did you see in that place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was startled, and as if deceived in her expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? In Peter Ivanovitch&rsquo;s rooms? There was Mr. Laspara and three other
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! The vanguard&mdash;the forlorn hope of the great plot,&rdquo; he commented
      to himself. &ldquo;Bearers of the spark to start an explosion which is meant to
      change fundamentally the lives of so many millions in order that Peter
      Ivanovitch should be the head of a State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are teasing me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our dear one told me once to remember
      that men serve always something greater than themselves&mdash;the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our dear one,&rdquo; he repeated slowly. The effort he made to appear unmoved
      absorbed all the force of his soul. He stood before her like a being with
      hardly a breath of life. His eyes, even as under great physical suffering,
      had lost all their fire. &ldquo;Ah! your brother.... But on your lips, in your
      voice, it sounds...and indeed in you everything is divine.... I wish I
      could know the innermost depths of your thoughts, of your feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, Kirylo Sidorovitch?&rdquo; she cried, alarmed by these words coming
      out of strangely lifeless lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear. It is not to betray you. So you went there?... And Sophia
      Antonovna, what did she tell you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said very little, really. She knew that I should hear everything from
      you. She had no time for more than a few words.&rdquo; Miss Haldin&rsquo;s voice
      dropped and she became silent for a moment. &ldquo;The man, it appears, has
      taken his life,&rdquo; she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Natalia Victorovna,&rdquo; he asked after a pause, &ldquo;do you believe in
      remorse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can <i>you</i> know of it?&rdquo; he muttered thickly. &ldquo;It is not for such
      as you.... What I meant to ask was whether you believed in the efficacy of
      remorse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated as though she had not understood, then her face lighted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is absolved. Moreover, that Ziemianitch was a brute, a drunken
      brute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder passed through Natalia Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a man of the people,&rdquo; Razumov went on, &ldquo;to whom they, the
      revolutionists, tell a tale of sublime hopes. Well, the people must be
      forgiven.... And you must not believe all you&rsquo;ve heard from that source,
      either,&rdquo; he added, with a sort of sinister reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are concealing something from me,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, Natalia Victorovna, believe in the duty of revenge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Kirylo Sidorovitch. I believe that the future shall be merciful
      to us all. Revolutionist and reactionary, victim and executioner, betrayer
      and betrayed, they shall all be pitied together when the light breaks on
      our black sky at last. Pitied and forgotten; for without that there can be
      no union and no love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear. No revenge for you, then? Never? Not the least bit?&rdquo; He smiled
      bitterly with his colourless lips. &ldquo;You yourself are like the very spirit
      of that merciful future. Strange that it does not make it easier.... No!
      But suppose that the real betrayer of your brother&mdash;Ziemianitch had a
      part in it too, but insignificant and quite involuntary&mdash;suppose that
      he was a young man, educated, an intellectual worker, thoughtful, a man
      your brother might have trusted lightly, perhaps, but still&mdash;suppose....
      But there&rsquo;s a whole story there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know the story! But why, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it. There is a staircase in it, and even phantoms, but that
      does not matter if a man always serves something greater than himself&mdash;the
      idea. I wonder who is the greatest victim in that tale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that tale!&rdquo; Miss Haldin repeated. She seemed turned into stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I came to you? It is simply because there is no one
      anywhere in the whole great world I could go to. Do you understand what I
      say? Not one to go to. Do you conceive the desolation of the thought&mdash;no
      one&mdash;to&mdash;go&mdash;to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Utterly misled by her own enthusiastic interpretation of two lines in the
      letter of a visionary, under the spell of her own dread of lonely days, in
      their overshadowed world of angry strife, she was unable to see the truth
      struggling on his lips. What she was conscious of was the obscure form of
      his suffering. She was on the point of extending her hand to him
      impulsively when he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour after I saw you first I knew how it would be. The terrors of
      remorse, revenge, confession, anger, hate, fear, are like nothing to the
      atrocious temptation which you put in my way the day you appeared before
      me with your voice, with your face, in the garden of that accursed villa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked utterly bewildered for a moment; then, with a sort of
      despairing insight went straight to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The story, Kirylo Sidorovitch, the story!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no more to tell!&rdquo; He made a movement forward, and she actually
      put her hand on his shoulder to push him away; but her strength failed
      her, and he kept his ground, though trembling in every limb. &ldquo;It ends here&mdash;on
      this very spot.&rdquo; He pressed a denunciatory finger to his breast with
      force, and became perfectly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran forward, snatching up the chair, and was in time to catch hold of
      Miss Haldin and lower her down. As she sank into it she swung half round
      on my arm, and remained averted from us both, drooping over the back. He
      looked at her with an appalling expressionless tranquillity. Incredulity,
      struggling with astonishment, anger, and disgust, deprived me for a time
      of the power of speech. Then I turned on him, whispering from very rage&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is monstrous. What are you staying for? Don&rsquo;t let her catch sight of
      you again. Go away!...&rdquo; He did not budge. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand that your
      presence is intolerable&mdash;even to me? If there&rsquo;s any sense of shame in
      you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly his sullen eyes moved ill my direction. &ldquo;How did this old man come
      here?&rdquo; he muttered, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Miss Haldin sprang up from the chair, made a few steps, and
      tottered. Forgetting my indignation, and even the man himself, I hurried
      to her assistance. I took her by the arm, and she let me lead her into the
      drawing-room. Away from the lamp, in the deeper dusk of the distant end,
      the profile of Mrs. Haldin, her hands, her whole figure had the stillness
      of a sombre painting. Miss Haldin stopped, and pointed mournfully at the
      tragic immobility of her mother, who seemed to watch a beloved head lying
      in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gesture had an unequalled force of expression, so far-reaching in its
      human distress that one could not believe that it pointed out merely the
      ruthless working of political institutions. After assisting Miss Haldin to
      the sofa, I turned round to go back and shut the door Framed in the
      opening, in the searching glare of the white anteroom, my eyes fell on
      Razumov, still there, standing before the empty chair, as if rooted for
      ever to the spot of his atrocious confession. A wonder came over me that
      the mysterious force which had torn it out of him had failed to destroy
      his life, to shatter his body. It was there unscathed. I stared at the
      broad line of his shoulders, his dark head, the amazing immobility of his
      limbs. At his feet the veil dropped by Miss Haldin looked intensely black
      in the white crudity of the light. He was gazing at it spell-bound. Next
      moment, stooping with an incredible, savage swiftness, he snatched it up
      and pressed it to his face with both hands. Something, extreme
      astonishment perhaps, dimmed my eyes, so that he seemed to vanish before
      he moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slamming of the outer door restored my sight, and I went on
      contemplating the empty chair in the empty ante-room. The meaning of what
      I had seen reached my mind with a staggering shock. I seized Natalia
      Haldin by the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That miserable wretch has carried off your veil!&rdquo; I cried, in the scared,
      deadened voice of an awful discovery. &ldquo;He....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest remained unspoken. I stepped back and looked down at her, in
      silent horror. Her hands were lying lifelessly, palms upwards, on her lap.
      She raised her grey eyes slowly. Shadows seemed to come and go in them as
      if the steady flame of her soul had been made to vacillate at last in the
      cross-currents of poisoned air from the corrupted dark immensity claiming
      her for its own, where virtues themselves fester into crimes in the
      cynicism of oppression and revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to be more unhappy....&rdquo; The languid whisper of her voice
      struck me with dismay. &ldquo;It is impossible.... I feel my heart becoming like
      ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov walked straight home on the wet glistening pavement. A heavy
      shower passed over him; distant lightning played faintly against the
      fronts of the dumb houses with the shuttered shops all along the Rue de
      Carouge; and now and then, after the faint flash, there was a faint,
      sleepy rumble; but the main forces of the thunderstorm remained massed
      down the Rhone valley as if loath to attack the respectable and
      passionless abode of democratic liberty, the serious-minded town of dreary
      hotels, tendering the same indifferent, hospitality to tourists of all
      nations and to international conspirators of every shade.
    </p>

      The owner of the shop was making ready to close when Razumov entered and
      without a word extended his hand for the key of his room. On reaching it
      for him, from a shelf, the man was about to pass a small joke as to taking
      the air in a thunderstorm, but, after looking at the face of his lodger,
      he only observed, just to say something&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got very wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am washed clean,&rdquo; muttered Razumov, who was dripping from head to
      foot, and passed through the inner door towards the staircase leading to
      his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not change his clothes, but, after lighting the candle, took off
      his watch and chain, laid them on the table, and sat down at once to
      write. The book of his compromising record was kept in a locked drawer,
      which he pulled out violently, and did not even trouble to push back
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this queer pedantism of a man who had read, thought, lived, pen in
      hand, there is the sincerity of the attempt to grapple by the same means
      with another profounder knowledge. After some passages which have been
      already made use of in the building up of this narrative, or add nothing
      new to the psychological side of this disclosure (there is even one more
      allusion to the silver medal in this last entry), comes a page and a half
      of incoherent writing where his expression is baffled by the novelty and
      the mysteriousness of that side of our emotional life to which his
      solitary existence had been a stranger. Then only he begins to address
      directly the reader he had in his mind, trying to express in broken
      sentences, full of wonder and awe, the sovereign (he uses that very word)
      power of her person over his imagination, in which lay the dormant seed of
      her brother&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... The most trustful eyes in the world&mdash;your brother said of you
      when he was as well as a dead man already. And when you stood before me
      with your hand extended, I remembered the very sound of his voice, and I
      looked into your eyes&mdash;and that was enough. I knew that something had
      happened, but I did not know then what.... But don&rsquo;t be deceived, Natalia
      Victorovna. I believed that I had in my breast nothing but an
      inexhaustible fund of anger and hate for you both. I remembered that he
      had looked to you for the perpetuation of his visionary soul. He, this man
      who had robbed me of my hard-working, purposeful existence. I, too, had my
      guiding idea; and remember that, amongst us, it is more difficult to lead
      a life of toil and self-denial than to go out in the street and kill from
      conviction. But enough of that. Hate or no hate, I felt at once that,
      while shunning the sight of you, I could never succeed in driving away
      your image. I would say, addressing that dead man, &lsquo;Is this the way you
      are going to haunt me?&rsquo; It is only later on that I understood&mdash;only
      to-day, only a few hours ago. What could I have known of what was tearing
      me to pieces and dragging the secret for ever to my lips? You were
      appointed to undo the evil by making me betray myself back into truth and
      peace. You! And you have done it in the same way, too, in which he ruined
      me: by forcing upon me your confidence. Only what I detested him for, in
      you ended by appearing noble and exalted. But, I repeat, be not deceived.
      I was given up to evil. I exulted in having induced that silly innocent
      fool to steal his father&rsquo;s money. He was a fool, but not a thief. I made
      him one. It was necessary. I had to confirm myself in my contempt and hate
      for what I betrayed. I have suffered from as many vipers in my heart as
      any social democrat of them all&mdash;vanity, ambitions, jealousies,
      shameful desires, evil passions of envy and revenge. I had my security
      stolen from me, years of good work, my best hopes. Listen&mdash;now comes
      the true confession. The other was nothing. To save me, your trustful eyes
      had to entice my thought to the very edge of the blackest treachery. I
      could see them constantly looking at me with the confidence of your pure
      heart which had not been touched by evil things. Victor Haldin had stolen
      the truth of my life from me, who had nothing else in the world, and he
      boasted of living on through you on this earth where I had no place to lay
      my head on. She will marry some day, he had said&mdash;and your eyes were
      trustful. And do you know what I said to myself? I shall steal his
      sister&rsquo;s soul from her. When we met that first morning in the gardens, and
      you spoke to me confidingly in the generosity of your spirit, I was
      thinking, &lsquo;Yes, he himself by talking of her trustful eyes has delivered
      her into my hands!&rsquo; If you could have looked then into my heart, you would
      have cried out aloud with terror and disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps no one will believe the baseness of such an intention to be
      possible. It&rsquo;s certain that, when we parted that morning, I gloated over
      it. I brooded upon the best way. The old man you introduced me to insisted
      on walking with me. I don&rsquo;t know who he is. He talked of you, of your
      lonely, helpless state, and every word of that friend of yours was egging
      me on to the unpardonable sin of stealing a soul. Could he have been the
      devil himself in the shape of an old Englishman? Natalia Victorovna, I was
      possessed! I returned to look at you every day, and drink in your presence
      the poison of my infamous intention. But I foresaw difficulties. Then
      Sophia Antonovna, of whom I was not thinking&mdash;I had forgotten her
      existence&mdash;appears suddenly with that tale from St. Petersburg....
      The only thing needed to make me safe&mdash;a trusted revolutionist for
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was as if Ziemianitch had hanged himself to help me on to further
      crime. The strength of falsehood seemed irresistible. These people stood
      doomed by the folly and the illusion that was in them&mdash;they being
      themselves the slaves of lies. Natalia Victorovna, I embraced the might of
      falsehood, I exulted in it&mdash;I gave myself up to it for a time. Who
      could have resisted! You yourself were the prize of it. I sat alone in my
      room, planning a life, the very thought of which makes me shudder now,
      like a believer who had been tempted to an atrocious sacrilege. But I
      brooded ardently over its images. The only thing was that there seemed to
      be no air in it. And also I was afraid of your mother. I never knew mine.
      I&rsquo;ve never known any kind of love. There is something in the mere word....
      Of you, I was not afraid&mdash;forgive me for telling you this. No, not of
      you. You were truth itself. You could not suspect me. As to your mother,
      you yourself feared already that her mind had given way from grief. Who
      could believe anything against me? Had not Ziemianitch hanged himself from
      remorse? I said to myself, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s put it to the test, and be done with it
      once for all.&rsquo; I trembled when I went in; but your mother hardly listened
      to what I was saying to her, and, in a little while, seemed to have
      forgotten my very existence. I sat looking at her. There was no longer
      anything between you and me. You were defenceless&mdash;and soon, very
      soon, you would be alone.... I thought of you. Defenceless. For days you
      have talked with me&mdash;opening your heart. I remembered the shadow of
      your eyelashes over your grey trustful eyes. And your pure forehead! It is
      low like the forehead of statues&mdash;calm, unstained. It was as if your
      pure brow bore a light which fell on me, searched my heart and saved me
      from ignominy, from ultimate undoing. And it saved you too. Pardon my
      presumption. But there was that in your glances which seemed to tell me
      that you.... Your light! your truth! I felt that I must tell you that I
      had ended by loving you. And to tell you that I must first confess.
      Confess, go out&mdash;and perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suddenly you stood before me! You alone in all the world to whom I must
      confess. You fascinated me&mdash;you have freed me from the blindness of
      anger and hate&mdash;the truth shining in you drew the truth out of me.
      Now I have done it; and as I write here, I am in the depths depths of
      anguish, but there is air to breathe at last&mdash;air! And, by the by,
      that old man sprang up from somewhere as I was speaking to you, and raged
      at me like a disappointed devil. I suffer horribly, but I am not in
      despair. There is only one more thing to do for me. After that&mdash;if
      they let me&mdash;I shall go away and bury myself in obscure misery. In
      giving Victor Haldin up, it was myself, after all, whom I have betrayed
      most basely. You must believe what I say now, you can&rsquo;t refuse to believe
      this. Most basely. It is through you that I came to feel this so deeply.
      After all, it is they and not I who have the right on their side?&mdash;theirs
      is the strength of invisible powers. So be it. Only don&rsquo;t be deceived,
      Natalia Victorovna, I am not converted. Have I then the soul of a slave?
      No! I am independent&mdash;and therefore perdition is my lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On these words, he stopped writing, shut the book, and wrapped it in the
      black veil he had carried off. He then ransacked the drawers for paper and
      string, made up a parcel which he addressed to Miss Haldin, Boulevard des
      Philosophes, and then flung the pen away from him into a distant corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, he sat down with the watch before him. He could have gone out
      at once, but the hour had not struck yet. The hour would be midnight.
      There was no reason for that choice except that the facts and the words of
      a certain evening in his past were timing his conduct in the present. The
      sudden power Natalia Haldin had gained over him he ascribed to the same
      cause. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t walk with impunity over a phantom&rsquo;s breast,&rdquo; he heard
      himself mutter. &ldquo;Thus he saves me,&rdquo; he thought suddenly. &ldquo;He himself, the
      betrayed man.&rdquo; The vivid image of Miss Haldin seemed to stand by him,
      watching him relentlessly. She was not disturbing. He had done with life,
      and his thought even in her presence tried to take an impartial survey.
      Now his scorn extended to himself. &ldquo;I had neither the simplicity nor the
      courage nor the self-possession to be a scoundrel, or an exceptionally
      able man. For who, with us in Russia, is to tell a scoundrel from an
      exceptionally able man?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was the puppet of his past, because at the very stroke of midnight he
      jumped up and ran swiftly downstairs as if confident that, by the power of
      destiny, the house door would fly open before the absolute necessity of
      his errand. And as a matter of fact, just as he got to the bottom of the
      stairs, it was opened for him by some people of the house coming home late&mdash;two
      men and a woman. He slipped out through them into the street, swept then
      by a fitful gust of wind. They were, of course, very much startled. A
      flash of lightning enabled them to observe him walking away quickly. One
      of the men shouted, and was starting in pursuit, but the woman had
      recognized him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s only that young Russian from the
      third floor.&rdquo; The darkness returned with a single clap of thunder, like a
      gun fired for a warning of his escape from the prison of lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have heard at some time or other and now remembered unconsciously
      that there was to be a gathering of revolutionists at the house of Julius
      Laspara that evening. At any rate, he made straight for the Laspara house,
      and found himself without surprise ringing at its street door, which, of
      course, was closed. By that time the thunderstorm had attacked in earnest.
      The steep incline of the street ran with water, the thick fall of rain
      enveloped him like a luminous veil in the play of lightning. He was
      perfectly calm, and, between the crashes, listened attentively to the
      delicate tinkling of the doorbell somewhere within the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some difficulty before he was admitted. His person was not known
      to that one of the guests who had volunteered to go downstairs and see
      what was the matter. Razumov argued with him patiently. There could be no
      harm in admitting a caller. He had something to communicate to the company
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of importance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be for the hearers to judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Urgent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a moment&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, one of the Laspara daughters descended the stairs, small lamp in
      hand, in a grimy and crumpled gown, which seemed to hang on her by a
      miracle, and looking more than ever like an old doll with a dusty brown
      wig, dragged from under a sofa. She recognized Razumov at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do? Of course you may come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following her light, Razumov climbed two flights of stairs from the lower
      darkness. Leaving the lamp on a bracket on the landing, she opened a door,
      and went in, accompanied by the sceptical guest. Razumov entered last. He
      closed the door behind him, and stepping on one side, put his back against
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three little rooms <i>en suite</i>, with low, smoky ceilings and lit
      by paraffin lamps, were crammed with people. Loud talking was going on in
      all three, and tea-glasses, full, half-full, and empty, stood everywhere,
      even on the floor. The other Laspara girl sat, dishevelled and languid,
      behind an enormous samovar. In the inner doorway Razumov had a glimpse of
      the protuberance of a large stomach, which he recognized. Only a few feet
      from him Julius Laspara was getting down hurriedly from his high stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the midnight visitor caused no small sensation. Laspara
      is very summary in his version of that night&rsquo;s happenings. After some
      words of greeting, disregarded by Razumov, Laspara (ignoring purposely his
      guest&rsquo;s soaked condition and his extraordinary manner of presenting
      himself) mentioned something about writing an article. He was growing
      uneasy, and Razumov appeared absent-minded. &ldquo;I have written already all I
      shall ever write,&rdquo; he said at last, with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole company&rsquo;s attention was riveted on the new-comer, dripping with
      water, deadly pale, and keeping his position against the wall. Razumov put
      Laspara gently aside, as though he wished to be seen from head to foot by
      everybody. By then the buzz of conversations had died down completely,
      even in the most distant of the three rooms. The doorway facing Razumov
      became blocked by men and women, who craned their necks and certainly
      seemed to expect something startling to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      A squeaky, insolent declaration was heard from that group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know this ridiculously conceited individual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What individual?&rdquo; asked Razumov, raising his bowed head, and searching
      with his eyes all the eyes fixed upon him. An intense surprised silence
      lasted for a time. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, thinking over the form of his confession, and found it
      suddenly, unavoidably suggested by the fateful evening of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am come here,&rdquo; he began, in a clear voice, &ldquo;to talk of an individual
      called Ziemianitch. Sophia Antonovna has informed me that she would make
      public a certain letter from St. Petersburg....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophia Antonovna has left us early in the evening,&rdquo; said Laspara. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      quite correct. Everybody here has heard....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Razumov interrupted, with a shade of impatience, for his
      heart was beating strongly. Then, mastering his voice so far that there
      was even a touch of irony in his clear, forcible enunciation&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In justice to that individual, the much ill-used peasant, Ziemianitch, I
      now declare solemnly that the conclusions of that letter calumniate a man
      of the people&mdash;a bright Russian soul. Ziemianitch had nothing to do
      with the actual arrest of Victor Haldin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov dwelt on the name heavily, and then waited till the faint,
      mournful murmur which greeted it had died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Victor Victorovitch Haldin,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;acting with, no doubt,
      noble-minded imprudence, took refuge with a certain student of whose
      opinions he knew nothing but what his own illusions suggested to his
      generous heart. It was an unwise display of confidence. But I am not here
      to appreciate the actions of Victor Haldin. Am I to tell you of the
      feelings of that student, sought out in his obscure solitude, and menaced
      by the complicity forced upon him? Am I to tell you what he did? It&rsquo;s a
      rather complicated story. In the end the student went to General T&mdash;-
      himself, and said, &lsquo;I have the man who killed de P&mdash;- locked up in my
      room, Victor Haldin&mdash;a student like myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great buzz arose, in which Razumov raised his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observe&mdash;that man had certain honest ideals in view. But I didn&rsquo;t
      come here to explain him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But you must explain how you know all this,&rdquo; came in grave tones from
      somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A vile coward!&rdquo; This simple cry vibrated with indignation. &ldquo;Name him!&rdquo;
       shouted other voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you clamouring for?&rdquo; said Razumov disdainfully, in the profound
      silence which fell on the raising of his hand. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you all understood
      that I am that man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laspara went away brusquely from his side and climbed upon his stool. In
      the first forward surge of people towards him, Razumov expected to be torn
      to pieces, but they fell back without touching him, and nothing came of it
      but noise. It was bewildering. His head ached terribly. In the confused
      uproar he made out several times the name of Peter Ivanovitch, the word
      &ldquo;judgement,&rdquo; and the phrase, &ldquo;But this is a confession,&rdquo; uttered by
      somebody in a desperate shriek. In the midst of the tumult, a young man,
      younger than himself, approached him with blazing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must beg you,&rdquo; he said, with venomous politeness, &ldquo;to be good enough
      not to move from this spot till you are told what you are to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I came in voluntarily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. But you won&rsquo;t go out till you are permitted,&rdquo; retorted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      He beckoned with his hand, calling out, &ldquo;Louisa! Louisa! come here,
      please&rdquo;; and, presently, one of the Laspara girls (they had been staring
      at Razumov from behind the samovar) came along, trailing a bedraggled tail
      of dirty flounces, and dragging with her a chair, which she set against
      the door, and, sitting down on it, crossed her legs. The young man thanked
      her effusively, and rejoined a group carrying on an animated discussion in
      low tones. Razumov lost himself for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A squeaky voice screamed, &ldquo;Confession or no confession, you are a police
      spy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The revolutionist Nikita had pushed his way in front of Razumov, and faced
      him with his big, livid cheeks, his heavy paunch, bull neck, and enormous
      hands. Razumov looked at the famous slayer of gendarmes in silent disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you?&rdquo; he said, very low, then shut his eyes, and rested the
      back of his head against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better for you to depart now.&rdquo; Razumov heard a mild, sad
      voice, and opened his eyes. The gentle speaker was an elderly man, with a
      great brush of fine hair making a silvery halo all round his keen,
      intelligent face. &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch shall be informed of your confession&mdash;and
      you shall be directed....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Nikita, nicknamed Necator, standing by, he appealed to
      him in a murmur&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can we do? After this piece of sincerity he cannot be dangerous
      any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other muttered, &ldquo;Better make sure of that before we let him go. Leave
      that to me. I know how to deal with such gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He exchanged meaning glances with two or three men, who nodded slightly,
      then turning roughly to Razumov, &ldquo;You have heard? You are not wanted here.
      Why don&rsquo;t you get out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Laspara girl on guard rose, and pulled the chair out of the way
      unemotionally. She gave a sleepy stare to Razumov, who started, looked
      round the room and passed slowly by her as if struck by some sudden
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you to observe,&rdquo; he said, already on the landing, &ldquo;that I had only
      to hold my tongue. To-day, of all days since I came amongst you, I was
      made safe, and to-day I made myself free from falsehood, from remorse&mdash;independent
      of every single human being on this earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his back on the room, and walked towards the stairs, but, at the
      violent crash of the door behind him, he looked over his shoulder and saw
      that Nikita, with three others, had followed him out. &ldquo;They are going to
      kill me, after all,&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had time to turn round and confront them fairly, they set on him
      with a rush. He was driven headlong against the wall. &ldquo;I wonder how,&rdquo; he
      completed his thought. Nikita cried, with a shrill laugh right in his
      face, &ldquo;We shall make you harmless. You wait a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Razumov did not struggle. The three men held him pinned against the wall,
      while Nikita, taking up a position a little on one side, deliberately
      swung off his enormous arm. Razumov, looking for a knife in his hand, saw
      it come at him open, unarmed, and received a tremendous blow on the side
      of his head over his ear. At the same time he heard a faint, dull
      detonating sound, as if some one had fired a pistol on the other side of
      the wall. A raging fury awoke in him at this outrage. The people in
      Laspara&rsquo;s rooms, holding their breath, listened to the desperate scuffling
      of four men all over the landing; thuds against the walls, a terrible
      crash against the very door, then all of them went down together with a
      violence which seemed to shake the whole house. Razumov, overpowered,
      breathless, crushed under the weight of his assailants, saw the monstrous
      Nikita squatting on his heels near his head, while the others held him
      down, kneeling on his chest, gripping his throat, lying across his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn his face the other way,&rdquo; the paunchy terrorist directed, in an
      excited, gleeful squeak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Razumov could struggle no longer. He was exhausted; he had to watch
      passively the heavy open hand of the brute descend again in a degrading
      blow over his other ear. It seemed to split his head in two, and all at
      once the men holding him became perfectly silent&mdash;soundless as
      shadows. In silence they pulled him brutally to his feet, rushed with him
      noiselessly down the staircase, and, opening the door, flung him out into
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell forward, and at once rolled over and over helplessly, going down
      the short slope together with the rush of running rain water. He came to
      rest in the roadway of the street at the bottom, lying on his back, with a
      great flash of lightning over his face&mdash;a vivid, silent flash of
      lightning which blinded him utterly. He picked himself up, and put his arm
      over his eyes to recover his sight. Not a sound reached him from anywhere,
      and he began to walk, staggering, down a long, empty street. The lightning
      waved and darted round him its silent flames, the water of the deluge
      fell, ran, leaped, drove&mdash;noiseless like the drift of mist. In this
      unearthly stillness his footsteps fell silent on the pavement, while a
      dumb wind drove him on and on, like a lost mortal in a phantom world
      ravaged by a soundless thunderstorm. God only knows where his noiseless
      feet took him to that night, here and there, and back again without pause
      or rest. Of one place, at least, where they did lead him, we heard
      afterwards; and, in the morning, the driver of the first south-shore
      tramcar, clanging his bell desperately, saw a bedraggled, soaked man
      without a hat, and walking in the roadway unsteadily with his head down,
      step right in front of his car, and go under.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they picked him up, with two broken limbs and a crushed side, Razumov
      had not lost consciousness. It was as though he had tumbled, smashing
      himself, into a world of mutes. Silent men, moving unheard, lifted him up,
      laid him on the sidewalk, gesticulating and grimacing round him their
      alarm, horror, and compassion. A red face with moustaches stooped close
      over him, lips moving, eyes rolling. Razumov tried hard to understand the
      reason of this dumb show. To those who stood around him, the features of
      that stranger, so grievously hurt, seemed composed in meditation.
      Afterwards his eyes sent out at them a look of fear and closed slowly.
      They stared at him. Razumov made an effort to remember some French words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Je suis sourd</i>,&rdquo; he had time to utter feebly, before he fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is deaf,&rdquo; they exclaimed to each other. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he did not hear
      the car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They carried him off in that same car. Before it started on its journey, a
      woman in a shabby black dress, who had run out of the iron gate of some
      private grounds up the road, clambered on to the rear platform and would
      not be put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a relation,&rdquo; she insisted, in bad French. &ldquo;This young man is a
      Russian, and I am his relation.&rdquo; On this plea they let her have her way.
      She sat down calmly, and took his head on her lap; her scared faded eyes
      avoided looking at his deathlike face. At the corner of a street, on the
      other side of the town, a stretcher met the car. She followed it to the
      door of the hospital, where they let her come in and see him laid on a
      bed. Razumov&rsquo;s new-found relation never shed a tear, but the officials had
      some difficulty in inducing her to go away. The porter observed her
      lingering on the opposite pavement for a long time. Suddenly, as though
      she had remembered something, she ran off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ardent hater of all Finance ministers, the slave of Madame de S&mdash;,
      had made up her mind to offer her resignation as lady companion to the
      Egeria of Peter Ivanovitch. She had found work to do after her own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hours before, while the thunderstorm still raged in the night, there
      had been in the rooms of Julius Laspara a great sensation. The terrible
      Nikita, coming in from the landing, uplifted his squeaky voice in horrible
      glee before all the company&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Razumov! Mr. Razumov! The wonderful Razumov! He shall never be any use as
      a spy on any one. He won&rsquo;t talk, because he will never hear anything in
      his life&mdash;not a thing! I have burst the drums of his ears for him.
      Oh, you may trust me. I know the trick. Ha! Ha! Ha! I know the trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly a fortnight after her mother&rsquo;s funeral that I saw Natalia
      Haldin for the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those silent, sombre days the doors of the <i>appartement</i> on the
      Boulevard des Philosophes were closed to every one but myself. I believe I
      was of some use, if only in this, that I alone was aware of the incredible
      part of the situation. Miss Haldin nursed her mother alone to the last
      moment. If Razumov&rsquo;s visit had anything to do with Mrs. Haldin&rsquo;s end (and
      I cannot help thinking that it hastened it considerably), it is because
      the man, trusted impulsively by the ill-fated Victor Haldin, had failed to
      gain the confidence of Victor Haldin&rsquo;s mother. What tale, precisely, he
      told her cannot be known&mdash;at any rate, I do not know it&mdash;but to
      me she seemed to die from the shock of an ultimate disappointment borne in
      silence. She had not believed him. Perhaps she could not longer believe
      any one, and consequently had nothing to say to any one&mdash;not even to
      her daughter. I suspect that Miss Haldin lived the heaviest hours of her
      life by that silent death-bed. I confess I was angry with the
      broken-hearted old woman passing away in the obstinacy of her mute
      distrust of her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was all over I stood aside. Miss Haldin had her compatriots round
      her then. A great number of them attended the funeral. I was there too,
      but afterwards managed to keep away from Miss Haldin, till I received a
      short note rewarding my self-denial. &ldquo;It is as you would have it. I am
      going back to Russia at once. My mind is made up. Come and see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verily, it was a reward of discretion. I went without delay to receive it.
      The <i>appartement</i> of the Boulevard des Philosophes presented the
      dreary signs of impending abandonment. It looked desolate and as if
      already empty to my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing, we exchanged a few words about her health, mine, remarks as to
      some people of the Russian colony, and then Natalia Haldin, establishing
      me on the sofa, began to talk openly of her future work, of her plans. It
      was all to be as I had wished it. And it was to be for life. We should
      never see each other again. Never!
    </p>
    <p>
      I gathered this success to my breast. Natalia Haldin looked matured by her
      open and secret experiences. With her arms folded she walked up and down
      the whole length of the room, talking slowly, smooth-browed, with a
      resolute profile. She gave me a new view of herself, and I marvelled at
      that something grave and measured in her voice, in her movements, in her
      manner. It was the perfection of collected independence. The strength of
      her nature had come to surface because the obscure depths had been
      stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We two can talk of it now,&rdquo; she observed, after a silence and stopping
      short before me. &ldquo;Have you been to inquire at the hospital lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo; And as she looked at me fixedly, &ldquo;He will live, the doctors
      say. But I thought that Tekla....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tekla has not been near me for several days,&rdquo; explained Miss Haldin
      quickly. &ldquo;As I never offered to go to the hospital with her, she thinks
      that I have no heart. She is disillusioned about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Haldin smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She sits with him as long and as often as they will let her,&rdquo; I
      said. &ldquo;She says she must never abandon him&mdash;never as long as she
      lives. He&rsquo;ll need somebody&mdash;a hopeless cripple, and stone deaf with
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stone deaf? I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; murmured Natalia Haldin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. It seems strange. I am told there were no apparent injuries to the
      head. They say, too, that it is not very likely that he will live so very
      long for Tekla to take care of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Haldin shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While there are travellers ready to fall by the way our Tekla shall never
      be idle. She is a good Samaritan by an irresistible vocation. The
      revolutionists didn&rsquo;t understand her. Fancy a devoted creature like that
      being employed to carry about documents sewn in her dress, or made to
      write from dictation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not much perspicacity in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner uttered, I regretted that observation. Natalia Haldin, looking
      me straight in the face, assented by a slight movement of her head. She
      was not offended, but turning away began to pace the room again. To my
      western eyes she seemed to be getting farther and farther from me, quite
      beyond my reach now, but undiminished in the increasing distance. I
      remained silent as though it were hopeless to raise my voice. The sound of
      hers, so close to me, made me start a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tekla saw him picked up after the accident. The good soul never explained
      to me really how it came about. She affirms that there was some
      understanding between them&mdash;some sort of compact&mdash;that in any
      sore need, in misfortune, or difficulty, or pain, he was to come to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It is lucky for him that there was, then. He&rsquo;ll need
      all the devotion of the good Samaritan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a fact that Tekla, looking out of her window at five in the
      morning, for some reason or other, had beheld Razumov in the grounds of
      the Chateau Borel, standing stockstill, bare-headed in the rain, at the
      foot of the terrace. She had screamed out to him, by name, to know what
      was the matter. He never even raised his head. By the time she had dressed
      herself sufficiently to run downstairs he was gone. She started in
      pursuit, and rushing out into the road, came almost directly upon the
      arrested tramcar and the small knot of people picking up Razumov. That
      much Tekla had told me herself one afternoon we happened to meet at the
      door of the hospital, and without any kind of comment. But I did not want
      to meditate very long on the inwardness of this peculiar episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Natalia Victorovna, he shall need somebody when they dismiss him, on
      crutches and stone deaf from the hospital. But I do not think that when he
      rushed like an escaped madman into the grounds of the Chateau Borel it was
      to seek the help of that good Tekla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Natalia, stopping short before me, &ldquo;perhaps not.&rdquo; She sat down
      and leaned her head on her hand thoughtfully. The silence lasted for
      several minutes. During that time I remembered the evening of his
      atrocious confession&mdash;the plaint she seemed to have hardly enough
      life left in her to utter, &ldquo;It is impossible to be more unhappy....&rdquo; The
      recollection would have given me a shudder if I had not been lost in
      wonder at her force and her tranquillity. There was no longer any Natalia
      Haldin, because she had completely ceased to think of herself. It was a
      great victory, a characteristically Russian exploit in self-suppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalled me to myself by getting up suddenly like a person who has
      come to a decision. She walked to the writing-table, now stripped of all
      the small objects associated with her by daily use&mdash;a mere piece of
      dead furniture; but it contained something living, still, since she took
      from a recess a flat parcel which she brought to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a book,&rdquo; she said rather abruptly. &ldquo;It was sent to me wrapped up in
      my veil. I told you nothing at the time, but now I&rsquo;ve decided to leave it
      with you. I have the right to do that. It was sent to me. It is mine. You
      may preserve it, or destroy it after you have read it. And while you read
      it, please remember that I was defenceless. And that he..&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defenceless!&rdquo; I repeated, surprised, looking hard at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the very word written there,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s
      true! I <i>was</i> defenceless&mdash;but perhaps you were able to see that
      for yourself.&rdquo; Her face coloured, then went deadly pale. &ldquo;In justice to
      the man, I want you to remember that I was. Oh, I was, I was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose, a little shakily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not likely to forget anything you say at this our last parting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand fell into mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to believe that it must be good-bye with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned my pressure and our hands separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am leaving here to-morrow. My eyes are open at last and my hands
      are free now. As for the rest&mdash;which of us can fail to hear the
      stifled cry of our great distress? It may be nothing to the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is more conscious of your discordant voices,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It is
      the way of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She bowed her head in assent, and hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;I must
      own to you that I shall never give up looking forward to the day when all
      discord shall be silenced. Try to imagine its dawn! The tempest of blows
      and of execrations is over; all is still; the new sun is rising, and the
      weary men united at last, taking count in their conscience of the ended
      contest, feel saddened by their victory, because so many ideas have
      perished for the triumph of one, so many beliefs have abandoned them
      without support. They feel alone on the earth and gather close together.
      Yes, there must be many bitter hours! But at last the anguish of hearts
      shall be extinguished in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on this last word of her wisdom, a word so sweet, so bitter, so cruel
      sometimes, I said good-bye to Natalia Haldin. It is hard to think I shall
      never look any more into the trustful eyes of that girl&mdash;wedded to an
      invincible belief in the advent of loving concord springing like a
      heavenly flower from the soil of men&rsquo;s earth, soaked in blood, torn by
      struggles, watered with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be understood that at that time I didn&rsquo;t know anything of Mr.
      Razumov&rsquo;s confession to the assembled revolutionists. Natalia Haldin might
      have guessed what was the &ldquo;one thing more&rdquo; which remained for him to do;
      but this my western eyes had failed to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tekla, the ex-lady companion of Madame de S&mdash;, haunted his bedside at
      the hospital. We met once or twice at the door of that establishment, but
      on these occasions she was not communicative. She gave me news of Mr.
      Razumov as concisely as possible. He was making a slow recovery, but would
      remain a hopeless cripple all his life. Personally, I never went near him:
      I never saw him again, after the awful evening when I stood by, a watchful
      but ignored spectator of his scene with Miss Haldin. He was in due course
      discharged from the hospital, and his &ldquo;relative&rdquo;&mdash;so I was told&mdash;had
      carried him off somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      My information was completed nearly two years later. The opportunity,
      certainly, was not of my seeking; it was quite accidentally that I met a
      much-trusted woman revolutionist at the house of a distinguished Russian
      gentleman of liberal convictions, who came to live in Geneva for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a quite different sort of celebrity from Peter Ivanovitch&mdash;a
      dark-haired man with kind eyes, high-shouldered, courteous, and with
      something hushed and circumspect in his manner. He approached me, choosing
      the moment when there was no one near, followed by a grey-haired, alert
      lady in a crimson blouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Sophia Antonovna wishes to be made known to you,&rdquo; he addressed me, in
      his guarded voice. &ldquo;And so I leave you two to have a talk together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never have intruded myself upon your notice,&rdquo; the grey-haired
      lady began at once, &ldquo;if I had not been charged with a message for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a message of a few friendly words from Natalia Haldin. Sophia
      Antonovna had just returned from a secret excursion into Russia, and had
      seen Miss Haldin. She lived in a town &ldquo;in the centre,&rdquo; sharing her
      compassionate labours between the horrors of overcrowded jails, and the
      heartrending misery of bereaved homes. She did not spare herself in good
      service, Sophia Antonovna assured me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a faithful soul, an undaunted spirit and an indefatigable body,&rdquo;
       the woman revolutionist summed it all up, with a touch of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conversation thus engaged was not likely to drop from want of interest
      on my side. We went to sit apart in a corner where no one interrupted us.
      In the course of our talk about Miss Haldin, Sophia Antonovna remarked
      suddenly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you remember seeing me before? That evening when Natalia came
      to ask Peter Ivanovitch for the address of a certain Razumov, that young
      man who...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember perfectly,&rdquo; I said. When Sophia Antonovna learned that I had
      in my possession that young man&rsquo;s journal given me by Miss Haldin she
      became intensely interested. She did not conceal her curiosity to see the
      document.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offered to show it to her, and she at once volunteered to call on me
      next day for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned over the pages greedily for an hour or more, and then handed me
      the book with a faint sigh. While moving about Russia, she had seen
      Razumov too. He lived, not &ldquo;in the centre,&rdquo; but &ldquo;in the south.&rdquo; She
      described to me a little two-roomed wooden house, in the suburb of some
      very small town, hiding within the high plank-fence of a yard overgrown
      with nettles. He was crippled, ill, getting weaker every day, and Tekla
      the Samaritan tended him unweariedly with the pure joy of unselfish
      devotion. There was nothing in that task to become disillusioned about.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not hide from Sophia Antonovna my surprise that she should have
      visited Mr. Razumov. I did not even understand the motive. But she
      informed me that she was not the only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of <i>us</i> always go to see him when passing through. He is
      intelligent. We has ideas.... He talks well, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently I heard for the first time of Razumov&rsquo;s public confession in
      Laspara&rsquo;s house. Sophia Antonovna gave me a detailed relation of what had
      occurred there. Razumov himself had told her all about it, most minutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, looking hard at me with her brilliant black eyes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are evil moments in every life. A false suggestion enters one&rsquo;s
      brain, and then fear is born&mdash;fear of oneself, fear for oneself. Or
      else a false courage&mdash;who knows? Well, call it what you like; but
      tell me, how many of them would deliver themselves up deliberately to
      perdition (as he himself says in that book) rather than go on living,
      secretly debased in their own eyes? How many?... And please mark this&mdash;he
      was safe when he did it. It was just when he believed himself safe and
      more&mdash;infinitely more&mdash;when the possibility of being loved by
      that admirable girl first dawned upon him, that he discovered that his
      bitterest railings, the worst wickedness, the devil work of his hate and
      pride, could never cover up the ignominy of the existence before him.
      There&rsquo;s character in such a discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I accepted her conclusion in silence. Who would care to question the
      grounds of forgiveness or compassion? However, it appeared later on, that
      there was some compunction, too, in the charity extended by the
      revolutionary world to Razumov the betrayer. Sophia Antonovna continued
      uneasily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, you know, he was the victim of an outrage. It was not
      authorized. Nothing was decided as to what was to be done with him. He had
      confessed voluntarily. And that Nikita who burst the drums of his ears
      purposely, out on the landing, you know, as if carried away by indignation&mdash;well,
      he has turned out to be a scoundrel of the worst kind&mdash;a traitor
      himself, a betrayer&mdash;a spy! Razumov told me he had charged him with
      it by a sort of inspiration....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a glimpse of that brute,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How any of you could have been
      deceived for half a day passes my comprehension!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! There! Don&rsquo;t talk of it. The first time I saw him, I, too, was
      appalled. They cried me down. We were always telling each other, &lsquo;Oh! you
      mustn&rsquo;t mind his appearance.&rsquo; And then he was always ready to kill. There
      was no doubt of it. He killed&mdash;yes! in both camps. The fiend....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Sophia Antonovna, after mastering the angry trembling of her lips,
      told me a very queer tale. It went that Councillor Mikulin, travelling in
      Germany (shortly after Razumov&rsquo;s disappearance from Geneva), happened to
      meet Peter Ivanovitch in a railway carriage. Being alone in the
      compartment, these two talked together half the night, and it was then
      that Mikulin the Police Chief gave a hint to the Arch-Revolutionist as to
      the true character of the arch-slayer of gendarmes. It looks as though
      Mikulin had wanted to get rid of that particular agent of his own! He
      might have grown tired of him, or frightened of him. It must also be said
      that Mikulin had inherited the sinister Nikita from his predecessor in
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this story, too, I received without comment in my character of a mute
      witness of things Russian, unrolling their Eastern logic under my Western
      eyes. But I permitted myself a question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, please, Sophia Antonovna, did Madame de S&mdash; leave all her
      fortune to Peter Ivanovitch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it.&rdquo; The woman revolutionist shrugged her shoulders in
      disgust. &ldquo;She died without making a will. A lot of nephews and nieces came
      down from St. Petersburg, like a flock of vultures, and fought for her
      money amongst themselves. All beastly Kammerherrs and Maids of Honour&mdash;abominable
      court flunkeys. Tfui!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One does not hear much of Peter Ivanovitch now,&rdquo; I remarked, after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch,&rdquo; said Sophia Antonovna gravely, &ldquo;has united himself to
      a peasant girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was truly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! On the Riviera?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense! Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna&rsquo;s tone was slightly tart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he, then, living actually in Russia? It&rsquo;s a tremendous risk&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;And all for the sake of a peasant girl. Don&rsquo;t you think
      it&rsquo;s very wrong of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna preserved a mysterious silence for a while, then made a
      statement. &ldquo;He just simply adores her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he? Well, then, I hope that she won&rsquo;t hesitate to beat him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophia Antonovna got up and wished me good-bye, as though she had not
      heard a word of my impious hope; but, in the very doorway, where I
      attended her, she turned round for an instant, and declared in a firm
      voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Ivanovitch is an inspired man.&rdquo;
     </p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
