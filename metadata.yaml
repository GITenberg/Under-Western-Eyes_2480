description: "Under Western Eyes (1911) is a novel by Joseph Conrad. The novel takes\
  \ place in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Geneva, Switzerland, and is viewed as Conrad's\
  \ response to the themes explored in Crime and Punishment; Conrad was reputed to\
  \ have detested Dostoevsky. It is also, some say, Conrad's response to his own early\
  \ life; his father was a famous revolutionary imprisoned by the Russians, but, instead\
  \ of following in his father's footsteps, at the age of sixteen Conrad left his\
  \ native land forever. Indeed, while writing Under Western Eyes, Conrad suffered\
  \ a weeks-long breakdown during which he conversed with the novel's characters in\
  \ Polish.\nThis novel is considered to be one of Conrad's major works and is close\
  \ in subject matter to The Secret Agent. It is full of cynicism and conflict about\
  \ the historical failures of revolutionary movements and ideals. Conrad remarks\
  \ in this book, as well as others, on the irrationality of life, the opacity of\
  \ character, the unfairness with which suffering is inflicted upon the innocent\
  \ and poor, and the careless disregard for the lives of those with whom we share\
  \ existence.\nThe book's first audience read it after the failed Russian Revolution\
  \ of 1905. A second audience read it after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, which\
  \ changed the reader's perception of the author's insight.\nWriting to Edward Garnett\
  \ in 1911, Conrad said « ...in this book I am concerned with nothing but ideas,\
  \ to the exclusion of everything else ».\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
